<div class="caption2">PREFACE.</div>

<hr style="width: 15%;">


<p>The vital importance of diffusing some knowledge of the leading
principles of Science among all classes of society, is becoming
daily more widely and deeply felt; and to meet and promote this
important movement, <span class="smcap">W. &amp; R. Chambers</span> have resolved on issuing
the present Series of <span class="smcap">Elementary Science Manuals</span>. The
Editors believe that they enjoy special facilities for the successful
execution of such an undertaking, owing to their long experience&mdash;now
extending over a period of forty years&mdash;in the work of
popular education, as well as to their having the co-operation of
writers specially qualified to treat the several subjects. In particular,
they are happy in having the editorial assistance of <span class="smcap">Andrew
Findlater, LL.D.</span>, to whose labours they were so much indebted
in the work of editing and preparing <i>Chamber's Encyclopædia</i>.</p>

<p>The Manuals of this series are intended to serve two somewhat
different purposes:</p>

<p>1. They are designed, in the first place, for <span class="smcap">Self-instruction</span>,
and will present, in a form suitable for private study, the main
subjects entering into an enlightened education; so that young
persons in earnest about self-culture may be able to master them
for themselves.</p>

<p>2. The other purpose of the Manuals is, to serve as <span class="smcap">Text-books
in Schools</span>. The mode of treatment naturally adopted in what is
to be studied without a teacher, so far from being a drawback in a
school-manual, will, it is believed, be a positive advantage. Instead
of a number of abrupt statements being presented, to be taken on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
trust and learned, as has been the usual method in school-teaching;
the subject is made, as far as possible, to unfold itself gradually,
as if the pupil were discovering the principles himself, the chief
function of the book being, to bring the materials before him, and
to guide him by the shortest road to the discovery. This is now
acknowledged to be the only profitable method of acquiring knowledge,
whether as regards self-instruction or learning at school.</p>

<p>For simplification in teaching, the subject has been divided into
sub-sections or articles, which are numbered continuously; and a
series of Questions, in corresponding divisions, has been appended.
These Questions, while they will enable the private student to test
for himself how far he has mastered the several parts of the subject
as he proceeds, will serve the teacher of a class as specimens of the
more detailed and varied examination to which he should subject
his pupils.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="caption3">NOTE BY THE AUTHOR.</div>

<p>In the present Manual of <span class="smcap">Geology</span> it has been the aim of the
author rather to indicate the methods of geological inquiry and
reasoning, than to present the learner with a tedious summary of
results. Attention has therefore been directed chiefly to the
physical branches of the science&mdash;Palæontology and Historical
Geology, which are very large subjects of themselves, having been
only lightly touched upon. The student who has attained to a fair
knowledge of the scope and bearing of Physical Geology, should
have little difficulty in subsequently tackling those manuals in
which the results obtained by geological investigation are specially
treated of.</p>

<p>1. <i>Definition.</i>&mdash;Geology is the science of the origin and
development of the structure of the earth. It treats of the
nature and mode of formation of the various materials of
which the earth's crust is composed; it seeks to discover
what mutations of land and water, and what changes of
climate, have supervened during the past; it endeavours to
trace the history of the multitudinous tribes of plants and
animals which have successively tenanted our globe. In a
word, Geology is the Physical Geography of past ages.</p>

<p>2. <i>Rocks.</i>&mdash;Every one knows that the crust of the earth is
composed of very various substances, some of which are
hard and crystalline in texture, like granite; others less
indurated and non-crystalline, such as sandstone, chalk,
shale, &amp;c.; while yet others are more or less soft and
incoherent masses, as gravel, sand, clay, peat, &amp;c. Now, all
these heterogeneous materials, whether they be hard or soft,
compact or loose, granular or crystalline, are termed <i>rocks</i>.
Blowing sand-dunes, alluvial silt and sand, and even peat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
are, geologically speaking, rocks, just as much as basalt or
any indurated building-stone. The variety of rocks is very
great, but we do not study these long before we become
aware that many kinds which present numerous contrasts
in detail, yet possess certain characters in common. And
this not only groups these diverse species together, but
serves also to distinguish them from other species of rock,
which in like manner are characterised by the presence of
some prevalent generic feature or features.</p>

<a name="CLASSIFICATION_OF_ROCKS"></a>
<p><i>Classification of Rocks.</i>&mdash;All the rocks that we know of are
thus capable of being arranged under <i>five</i> classes, as follows:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 4em;">
<table summary="Classification of Rocks">
<tr><td class="text_rt">I.</td><td class="smcap">Mechanically formed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="text_rt">II.</td><td class="smcap">Chemically formed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="text_rt">III.</td><td class="smcap">Organically derived.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="text_rt">IV.</td><td class="smcap">Metamorphic.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="text_rt">V.</td><td class="smcap">Igneous.</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>3. The <span class="smcap">Mechanically formed</span> class comprises a considerable
variety of rocks, all of which, however, come under
only two subdivisions&mdash;namely, <i>Sedimentary</i>, and <i>Eolian</i> or
<i>Aërial</i>, the former being by far the more important. Of the
<i>Sedimentary</i> group, there are three rocks which may be
taken as typical and representative&mdash;namely, <i>conglomerate</i>
or <i>puddingstone</i>, <i>sandstone</i>, and <i>shale</i>. A short examination
of the nature of these will sufficiently explain why
they come to be grouped together under one head. <i>Conglomerate</i>
consists of a mass of various-sized rounded stones
cemented together; each stone has been well rubbed, and
rolled, and rounded. It is quite obvious that the now
solid rock must at one time have existed in a loose and
unconsolidated state, like gravel and shingle. Nor can
we resist the conclusion that the stones were at one
time rolled about by the action of water&mdash;that being the
only mode in which gravel-stones are shaped. Again,
when we have an opportunity of examining any considerable
vertical thickness of conglomerate, we shall frequently
observe that the stones are arranged more or less definitely
along certain lines. These, there can be no question, are
<i>lines of deposition</i>&mdash;the rounded stones have evidently not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
been formed and accumulated all at once, but piled up
gradually, layer upon layer. And since there is no force in
nature, that we know of, save water in motion, that could
so round and smooth stones, and spread them out in successive
layers or beds, we may now amplify our definition of
conglomerate, and describe it as a <i>compacted mass of stones
which have been more or less rounded, and arranged in more
or less distinct layers or beds, by the action of water</i>.</p>

<p>4. <i>Sandstone</i> may at the outset be described as a <i>granular
non-crystalline rock</i>. This rock shews every degree of
coarseness, from a mass in which the constituent grains are
nearly as large as turnip-seed, down to a stone so fine in the
grain that we need a lens to discover what the particles
are of which it is composed. When these latter are
examined, they are found to exhibit marks of attrition,
just like the stones of a conglomerate. Sharp edges have
been worn off, and the grains rounded and rubbed; and
whereas lines of deposition are often obscure, and of infrequent
occurrence in conglomerate&mdash;in sandstone, on the
contrary, they are usually well marked and often abundant.
We can hardly doubt, therefore, that sandstone has also had
an <i>aqueous</i> origin, or in other words, that it has been formed
and accumulated by the force of water in motion. In short,
sandstone is merely compacted sand.</p>


<p>5. If it be easy to read the origin of conglomerate and
sand in the external character of their ingredients, and the
mode in which these have been arranged, we shall find it
not less easy to discover the origin of <i>shale</i>. Shale is, like
sandstone, a granular non-crystalline rock. The particles
of which it is built up are usually too small to be distinguished
without the aid of a lens, but when put under a
sufficient magnifying power, they exhibit evident marks of
attrition. In structure it differs widely from sandstone. In
the latter rock the layers of deposition, though frequently
numerous, are yet separated from each other by some considerable
distance, it may be by a few inches or by many
yards. But in shale the layers are so thin that we may
split the rock into <i>laminæ</i> or plates. Now we know that
many sedimentary materials of recent origin, such as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
silt of lakes, rivers, and estuaries, although when newly
dug into they appear to be more or less homogeneous, and
shew but few lines of deposition, yet when exposed to the
action of the atmosphere and dried, they very often split up
into layers exhibiting division planes as minute as any
observable in shale. There is no reason to doubt, therefore,
that shale is merely compacted silt and mud&mdash;the sediment
deposited by water. It becomes evident, therefore, that
conglomerate, sandstone, and shale are terms of one series.
They are all equally sedimentary deposits, and thus, if we
slightly modify our definition of conglomerate, we shall have
a definition which will include the three rocks we have been
considering. For they may all be described as <i>granular
non-crystalline rocks, the constituent ingredients of which
have been more or less rounded, and arranged in more or
less distinct layers, by the action of water</i>.</p>

<p>6. The <i>Eolian</i> or <i>Aërial</i> group of rocks embraces all
natural accumulations of organic or inorganic materials,
which have been formed upon the land. The group is
typically represented by <i>débris</i>, such as gathers on hill-slopes
and at the base of cliffs, by the <i>sand-hills</i> of deserts
and maritime districts, and by <i>soil</i>. All these accumulations
owe their origin to atmospheric agencies, as will be more
particularly described in the sequel. As the <i>Sedimentary</i>
and <i>Eolian</i> rocks are the results of the <i>mechanical</i> action of
water and the atmosphere, they are fitly arranged under
one great class&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Mechanically formed Rocks</span>.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">Chemically formed Rocks</span> constitute another well-marked
class, of which we may take <i>rock-salt</i> as a typical
example. This rock has evidently been deposited in water,
but not in the manner of a sedimentary bed. It is not
built up of water-worn particles which have been rolled
about and accumulated layer upon layer, but has been
slowly precipitated during the gradual evaporation of water
in which it was previously held in solution. Its formation
is therefore a chemical process. Various other rocks
come under the same category, as we shall afterwards
point out.</p>

<p>8. The <span class="smcap">Organically derived</span> class comprises a number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
of the most important and useful rock-masses. <i>Chalk</i> may
be selected as a typical example. Even a slight examination
shews that this rock differs widely from any of those
mentioned above. Conglomerate, sandstone, shale, &amp;c. are
built up of pebbles, particles, grains, &amp;c. of various inorganic
materials. But chalk, when looked at under the microscope,
betrays an organic origin. It consists, chiefly, of the hard
calcareous parts of animal organisms, and is more or less
abundantly stocked with the remains of corals, shells,
crustaceans, &amp;c. in every degree of preservation; indeed,
so abundant are these relics, that they go to form a great
proportion of the rock. <i>Coal</i> is another familiar example of
an organically derived rock, since it consists entirely of
vegetable remains.</p>

<p>9. The <span class="smcap">Metamorphic</span> class, as the name implies,
embraces all those rocks which have undergone some
decided change since the time of their formation. This
change generally consists in a re-arrangement of their constituent
elements, and has frequently resulted in giving a
crystalline texture to the rocks affected. Hence certain
sedimentary deposits like sandstone and shale have been
changed from granular into crystalline rocks, and the like
has happened to beds of limestone and chalk. <i>Mica-schist,
gneiss</i>, and <i>saccharoid marble</i> are typical of this
class.</p>

<p>10. The <span class="smcap">Igneous</span> rocks are those which owe their origin
to the action of the internal forces of the earth's crust.
Most of them have been in a state of fusion, and betray
their origin by their crystalline and sometimes glassy
texture, and also, as we shall see in another section, by the
mode of their occurrence. <i>Lava</i>, <i>basalt</i>, and <i>obsidian</i> are
characteristic types of this group of igneous rocks. Another
group embraces a large variety of igneous rocks which are
non-crystalline, and vary in texture from fine-grained,
almost compact, bedded masses, like certain varieties of
<i>tuff</i>, up to coarse, irregular accumulations of angular stones
imbedded in a fine-grained or gritty matrix, like <i>volcanic
breccia</i> and <i>volcanic agglomerate</i>.</p>

<br>
<hr style="color:#000; width: 15%;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>11. Having learned that all the rocks met with at the surface
of the earth's crust are capable of being arranged under a
few classes, we have now to investigate the matter more in
detail. It will be observed that the classification adopted
above is based chiefly upon the external characters of the
constituent ingredients of the rocks, and the mode in which
these particles have been collected. In some rocks the
component materials are crystalline, in others they are
rounded and worn; in one case they have been brought
together by precipitation from an aqueous solution, or
they have crystallised out from a mass of once molten
matter; in another case their collection and intimate
association is due to the mechanical action of the atmosphere
or of water, or to the agency of the organic forces.
We have next to inquire what is the nature of those crystals
and particles which are the ingredients of the rocks? The
answer to this question properly belongs to the science
of mineralogy, with which, however, the geologist must
necessarily make some acquaintance.</p>

<p>12. <i>Granite&mdash;its composition.</i>&mdash;It will tend to simplify
matters if we begin our inquiry by selecting for examination
some familiar rock, such as <i>granite</i>. This rock,
as one sees at a glance, is crystalline, nor is it difficult
to perceive that three separate kinds of ingredients go to
compose it. One of these we shall observe is a gray, or it
may be, clear glassy-looking substance, which is hard, and
will not scratch with a knife; another is of a pink, red,
gray, or sometimes even pale green colour, and scratches
with difficulty; while the third shews a glistering metallic
lustre, and is generally of a brownish or black colour. It
scratches easily with the knife, and can be split up into
flakes of extreme thinness. If the granite be one of the
coarse-grained varieties, we shall notice that these three
ingredients have each more or less definite crystalline forms;
so that they are not distinguished by colour and hardness
alone. The metallic-looking substance is <i>mica</i>; the hard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
gray, or glassy and unscratchable ingredient is <i>quartz</i>;
and the remaining material is <i>felspar</i>. The mineralogist's
analysis of granite ends here. But there is still much to
be learned about quartz, felspar, and mica; for, as the
chemist will tell us, these are not 'elementary substances.'
Quartz is a compound, consisting of two elements, one of
which is a non-metallic body (silicon), and the other an
invisible gas (oxygen). Felspar<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> is a still more complex
compound, being made up of two metals (potassium,
aluminium) and one non-metallic body (silicon), each of
which is united to an invisible gas (oxygen). Mica, again,
contains no fewer than four metals (potassium, magnesium,
iron, calcium) and one non-metallic body (silicon),
each of which is in like manner chemically united to
its share of oxygen. Thus the rock-forming substances,
quartz, felspar, and mica, have each a definite chemical
composition.</p>

<p>13. <i>Minerals.</i>&mdash;Now, any inorganic substance which has
a definite chemical composition, and crystallises in a
definite crystalline or geometric form, is termed a <i>mineral</i>.
Having once discovered that quartz is composed of silicon
and oxygen&mdash;that is, silica&mdash;and that the faces of its crystals
are arranged in a certain definite order, we may be quite sure
that any mineral which has not this composition and form
cannot be quartz. And so on with mica and felspar, and
every other mineral. The study of the geometric forms
assumed by minerals (crystallography) forms a department
of the science of mineralogy. But, in the great majority of
cases, the mineral ingredients of the rocks are either so
small individually, or so broken, and rounded, and altered,
that crystallography gives comparatively little aid to the
practical geologist in the field. He has, therefore, recourse
to other tests for the determination of the mineral constituents
of rocks. Many of these tests, however, can only
be applied by those who have had long experience. The
simplest and easiest way for the student to begin is to
examine the forms and appearance of the more common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
minerals in some collection, and thereafter to accustom his
eye to the aspect presented by the same minerals when
they are associated together in rocks, of which illustrative
specimens are now to be met with in most museums. The
microscope is largely employed by geologists for determining
the mineralogical composition of certain rocks; and,
indeed, many rocks can hardly be said to be thoroughly
known until they have been sliced and examined under the
microscope, and analysed by the chemist. But with a vast
number such minute examination is not required, the eye
after some practice being able to detect all that is needful
to be known.</p>

<div class="caption3">ROCK-FORMING MINERALS.</div>

<p>14. Nearly all the minerals we know of contain oxygen
as a necessary ingredient, there being only a very few
minerals in which that gas does not occur in chemical
union with other elements. Three of these minerals,
<i>sulphur</i>, the <i>diamond</i>, and <i>graphite</i>, consist of simple substances,
and are of great commercial importance, but none
of them is of so frequent occurrence, as a rock constituent,
as the minerals presently to be described. <i>Sulphur</i> occurs
sometimes in thin beds, but more frequently in small
nests and nodules, &amp;c. in other rocks, or in joints, and
fissures, and veins. It is frequently found in volcanic
districts. The <i>diamond</i>, which consists of pure <i>carbon</i>, is
generally met with in alluvial deposits, but sometimes, also,
in a curious flexible sandstone, called <i>itacolumite</i>. <i>Graphite</i>
is another form of carbon. It occurs both in a crystalline
and amorphous form, the latter, or non-crystalline kind,
being extensively used for lead-pencils. <i>Rock-salt</i> is a
<i>chloride of sodium</i>, and appears sometimes in masses of a
hundred feet and more in thickness. Another mineral which
contains no oxygen is the well-known <i>fluor-spar</i>. It occurs
chiefly in veins, and is often associated with ores. With
these, and a few other exceptions, all the minerals hitherto
discovered contain oxygen as an essential element; and so
large is the proportion of this gas which enters into union
with other elements to constitute the various minerals of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
which the rocks are composed, that it forms at least one-half
of all the ponderable matter near the earth's surface.
When the student learns that there are probably no fewer
than six or seven hundred different minerals, he will understand
how impossible it is to do more in a short geological
treatise than point out a few of the most commonly
occurring ones. And, indeed, a knowledge of the chief
rock-forming minerals, which are few in number, is all that
is absolutely requisite for geological purposes. Some of
these we accordingly proceed to name.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>15. <i>Quartz.</i>&mdash;This mineral has already been partially
described. It is the most abundant of all the rock-forming
minerals, and occurs in three forms: (1) <i>crystallised quartz</i>
or <i>rock crystal</i>; (2) <i>chalcedony</i>, both of which are composed
of silica&mdash;that is, silicon and oxygen; and (3) <i>hydrated
quartz</i>&mdash;that is, silica with the addition of water.</p>

<p><i>Hematite.</i>&mdash;This is an oxide of iron. It occurs in mammillary
rounded masses, with a fibrous structure, and a dull
metallic lustre. <i>Magnetite</i> or magnetic iron ore, <i>specular
iron</i>, and <i>limonite</i> are also oxides of iron. <i>Hematite</i> shews
a red streak when scratched with a knife, which distinguishes
it from magnetite.</p>

<p><i>Iron pyrites.</i>&mdash;This is a sulphide of iron of very common
occurrence. Its crystalline form is cubical. When broken,
it emits a sulphurous smell. The brass-yellow coloured
cubes so often seen in roofing-slates are familiar examples
of the mode of its occurrence. But it is also frequently
found in masses having a crystalline surface.</p>

<p>16. <span class="smcap">Sulphates.</span>&mdash;Only two sulphates may be noticed&mdash;namely,
<i>gypsum</i>, which is a sulphate of lime, with its varieties,
<i>selenite</i>, <i>satin-spar</i>, and <i>alabaster</i>; and <i>barytes</i>, a sulphate of
baryta. <i>Barytes</i> scratches easily with the knife, and from
its great specific gravity is often called <i>heavy-spar</i>. Gypsum
is softer than barytes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carbonates.</span>&mdash;Two of these only need be mentioned:
<i>calcite</i> or <i>calc-spar</i>, a carbonate of lime, which scratches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
with the knife, and effervesces readily with dilute hydrochloric
acid; and <i>arragonite</i>, also a carbonate of lime, but
denser than calcite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silicates.</span>&mdash;These are by far the most abundantly
occurring minerals. The species are also exceedingly
numerous, but we may note here only a few of the more
important. They are composed of silica and various bases,
such as lime, potash, magnesia, soda, alumina, &amp;c. <i>Augite</i>
or <i>pyroxene</i> is a black or greenish-black mineral, found,
either as crystals, which are generally small, or as rounded
grains and angular fragments, in basaltic and volcanic
rocks. It never occurs in granite rocks. It is brittle, and
has a vitreous or resinous lustre. There are a number of
varieties or sub-species of augite. <i>Hornblende</i>, like augite,
also includes a great many minerals. When the crystals
are small, it is often difficult to distinguish hornblende from
augite. Common hornblende occurs crystallised or massive,
and is dark green or black, with a vitreous lustre. It is
generally sub-translucent. It usually crystallises in igneous
rocks which contain much quartz or silica; while augite, on
the other hand, crystallises in igneous rocks which are of a
more basic character&mdash;that is to say, rocks in which silica is
not so abundantly present. <i>Felspar</i> is a generic term which
embraces a number of species, such as <i>orthoclase</i> or <i>potash-felspar</i>,
<i>albite</i> or <i>soda-felspar</i>, and <i>anorthite</i> or <i>lime-felspar</i>.
<i>Orthoclase</i> is white, red or pink, and gray. It is one of the
ordinary constituents of granite, and enters into the composition
of many rocks. <i>Albite</i> is usually white. It often
occurs as a constituent of granite, not unfrequently being
associated in the same rock with pink felspar or orthoclase.
In syenite and greenstone it occurs more commonly than
orthoclase. <i>Anorthite</i> occurs in white translucent or transparent
crystals. It is not so common a constituent of
rocks as either of the other felspars just referred to. <i>Mica</i>:
this term includes several minerals, which all agree in being
highly cleavable into thin elastic flakes or laminæ, which
have a glistening metallic lustre. Mica is one of the
common constituents of granite. <i>Talc</i> is a silvery white,
grayish, pale or dark-green coloured mineral, with a pearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
lustre. It splits readily into thin flakes, which are flexible,
but not elastic, and may be readily scratched with the nail.
It is unctuous and greasy to the touch. It occurs in beds
(<i>talc-slate</i>), and is often met with in districts occupied by
metamorphic crystalline rocks. <i>Serpentine</i> is generally of a
green colour, but brown, red, and variously mottled varieties
occur. It has a dull lustre, and is soft, and easily cut; it
is tough, however, and takes on a good polish. It forms
rock-masses in some places. The finer varieties are called
<i>noble serpentine</i>. <i>Chlorite</i> is another soft, easily scratched
mineral, generally of a dark-green colour. It has a pearly
lustre. Sometimes it occurs in beds (<i>chlorite-slate</i>), and is
often found coating the walls of fissures in certain rocks.
It has a somewhat greasy feel. The three last-mentioned
minerals&mdash;talc, serpentine, and chlorite&mdash;are all silicates of
magnesia. <i>Zeolites</i> is a term which comprises a number of
minerals of varying chemical composition, all of which tend
to form a jelly when treated with acids. When heated by
the blow-pipe they bubble up, owing to the escape of water;
hence their name <i>zeolites</i>, from <i>ze&#333;</i>, I boil, and <i>lithos</i>, a stone.
The zeolites occur very commonly in cavities in igneous
rocks, and also in mineral veins.</p>

<p>Having now mentioned the chief rock-forming minerals,
we proceed to a brief description of some of the more
typical representatives of the five great classes of rocks
referred to at <a href="#CLASSIFICATION_OF_ROCKS">page 8</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="PETROLOGY"></a>

<a name="MECHANICALLY_FORMED_ROCKS"></a>
<div class="caption3">MECHANICALLY FORMED ROCKS.</div>

<p>17. (<i>A.</i>) <span class="smcap">Sedimentary Class.</span>&mdash;Three of the most commonly
occurring rocks of this class have already been
described, but a few details are added here.</p>

<p><i>Conglomerate.</i>&mdash;This is a consolidated mass of more or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
less water-worn and rounded stones. These stones may be
of any size. When they are very large, the rock is called a
<i>coarse conglomerate</i>; the finer varieties, in which the stones
are small, are known as <i>pebbly conglomerates</i>. The ingredients
of a conglomerate may consist of any kind of
rock, or of a mixture of many different kinds. When they
consist entirely of quartz, the rock becomes <i>quartzose</i>. The
finer-grained conglomerates usually shew lines of deposition
or bedding, but in some of the coarser sorts it is often difficult
to detect any kind of arrangement. The stones are
usually imbedded in a matrix of quartzose grit and sand,
but sometimes this is very scanty. When the nature of
the material which binds the stones together is very well
marked, the rock becomes <i>ferruginous</i>, <i>calcareous</i>, <i>arenaceous</i>,
or <i>argillaceous</i>, according as the binding or cementing
material is <i>iron</i>, <i>lime</i>, <i>sand</i>, or <i>clay</i>. <i>Breccia</i> is a rock in
which the included fragments are <i>angular</i>.</p>

<p>18. <i>Sandstone</i> is, as already remarked, merely consolidated
sand. The coarser varieties, in which the grains are
as large and larger than turnip-seeds, are termed <i>grit</i>.
From these coarse varieties the rock passes insensibly, in
one direction, into a fine or pebbly conglomerate, and in
another into a rock, so fine-grained that a lens is needed to
distinguish the component particles. Quartz is the prevailing
ingredient&mdash;sometimes clear, at other times white.
Frequently, however, the grains are coated with an oxide of
iron, which gives the resulting rock a red colour. The
other colours assumed by sandstone&mdash;such as yellow, brown,
green, &amp;c.&mdash;are also in like manner due to the presence of
some compound of iron. When mica or felspar occurs
plentifully, we have, in the one case, <i>micaceous sandstone</i>,
and in the other <i>felspathic sandstone</i>. A sandstone in
which the grains are cemented by carbonate of lime is said
to be <i>calcareous</i>. <i>Freestone</i> is a sandstone which can be
worked freely in any direction. In most sandstones, the
lines of bedding are distinct; when they are so numerous
as to render the rock fissile, the sandstone is said to be
<i>shaly</i>.</p>

<p><i>Shale</i> is a more or less indurated fissile or laminated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
clay. When the rock becomes coarse by the admixture of
sand, it gradually passes into a <i>shaly sandstone</i>. There
are many other varieties of clay-rocks&mdash;such as <i>fire-clay</i>,
<i>pipe-clay</i>, <i>marl</i>, <i>loam</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;which are sufficiently
familiar.</p>

<p>19. (<i>B.</i>) <span class="smcap">Eolian</span> or <span class="smcap">Aërial Class</span>.&mdash;<i>Blown-sand</i> is found
at many places on sea-coasts. It generally forms smooth
rounded hummocks, which are sometimes arranged in long
lines parallel to the trend of the coast, as, for example, in
the Tents Moor, near St Andrews. The <i>sand-hills</i> of
deserts also belong to this class.</p>

<p><i>Débris</i> is the loose angular rubbish which collects at the
base of cliffs, on hill-tops, and hill-slopes. Immense accumulations
of it occur in lofty mountainous districts and in
arctic regions. In Nova Zembla, for example, the solid
rock of the country is almost concealed beneath a thick
covering of débris. But the various kinds of débris will be
more particularly described further on.</p>

<p><i>Soil.</i>&mdash;An account of this can hardly be given without
entering into the theory of its origin, and therefore we
reserve its consideration for the present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="CHEMICALLY_FORMED_ROCKS"></a>
<div class="caption3">CHEMICALLY FORMED ROCKS.</div>

<p>20. <i>Stalactites</i> and <i>stalagmites</i> are carbonates of lime.
They vary in colour, being white, or yellow, or brown. Stalactites
are usually found adhering to the roofs of limestone
caverns, &amp;c., or depending from limestone rocks; stalagmites,
on the other hand, commonly occur on the floors
of limestone caverns, where they often attain a thickness
of many feet.</p>

<p><i>Siliceous sinter</i> is silica with the addition of water&mdash;in
other words, a hydrated quartz. It is not a very abundant
rock, and is found chiefly in volcanic countries.</p>

<p><i>Rock-salt</i> has already been described. It occurs either
as thin beds, or in the form of thick cake-like masses, often
reaching ninety or one hundred feet in thickness. It is
rudely crystalline in texture, and is usually discoloured
brown and red with various impurities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="ORGANICALLY_DERIVED_ROCKS"></a>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>
<div class="caption3">ORGANICALLY DERIVED ROCKS.</div>

<p>21. <i>Limestone</i> consists of carbonate of lime, but usually
contains some impurities. The varieties of this rock are
numerous; some of them are as follows: <i>Chalk</i>; <i>oolite</i>, a
rock built up of little spheroidal concretions, whence its
name, <i>egg</i> or <i>roe stone</i> (the coarser oolites are called <i>pisolite</i>,
or <i>pea-stone</i>); <i>lacustrine limestone</i>, &amp;c. When much silica
is diffused through the rock, we have a <i>siliceous limestone</i>;
the presence of clay and of carbonaceous matter gives us
<i>argillaceous</i> and <i>carbonaceous limestones</i>. <i>Cornstone</i> is a
limestone containing a large quantity of arenaceous matter
or sand. Many limestones are distinguished by the different
kinds of organic remains which they yield. Thus, we
have <i>muschelkalk</i> or <i>shell-limestone</i>, <i>nummulitic</i>, <i>crinoidal</i>,
&amp;c. limestone. The crystalline limestones, such as <i>statuary
marble</i>, are metamorphosed limestones. Not a few limestones
are chemically formed rocks, and many, also, are
partly of chemical and partly of organic origin, so that no
hard and fast line can be drawn between these two classes
of rock.</p>

<p><i>Dolomite</i>, or <i>magnesian limestone</i>.&mdash;This is a compound
of carbonate of lime and carbonate of magnesia. Its colour
is usually yellow, or yellowish brown, but gray and black
varieties are sometimes met with. It is generally fine-grained,
with a crystalline texture, and pearly lustre. It
effervesces less freely with acids than pure limestone. In
many cases dolomite is merely a metamorphosed limestone.</p>

<p>22. <i>Coal</i> is composed of vegetable matter, but usually
contains a greater or less percentage of impurities. The
varieties of this substance are very numerous, and differ
from each other principally in regard to their bituminous
or non-bituminous character. Coal is bituminous or
non-bituminous according as it is less or more highly
mineralised. Bitumen results from the decomposition of
vegetable matter; but, when the mineralising process (to
which the formation of coal is due) has proceeded far
enough, the vegetable matter gradually loses its bituminous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
character, and the result is a non-bituminous coal. Varieties
of coal are the following: <i>Lignite</i> or <i>brown coal</i>; <i>caking coal</i>;
<i>cannel</i>, <i>parrot</i>, or <i>gas coal</i>; <i>splint coal</i>; <i>cherry</i> or <i>soft coal</i>;
<i>anthracite</i> or <i>blind coal</i>, so called because it burns with no
flame. <i>Peat</i> may be mentioned as another natural fuel.
It is composed of vegetable matter. In some kinds it is
so far decomposed, or mineralised, that the eye does not
detect vegetable fibres; when thoroughly dried, such peat
breaks like a good lignite, and forms an excellent fuel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="METAMORPHIC_ROCKS"></a>
<div class="caption3">METAMORPHIC ROCKS.</div>

<p>23. <i>Quartz-rock</i>, or <i>quartzite</i>, is an altered quartzose sandstone
or grit; it is generally a white or grayish-yellow rock,
very hard and compact. The original gritty character of
the rock is distinct, but the granules appear as if they had
been fused so far as to become mutually adherent. When
the altered sandstone has been composed of grains of quartz,
felspar, or mica, set in a siliceous, felspathic, or argillaceous
base, we get a rock called <i>greywacké</i>, which is usually gray
or grayish blue in colour.</p>

<p>24. <i>Clay-slate</i> is a grayish blue, or green, fine-grained
hard rock, which splits into numerous more or less thin
laminæ, which may or may not coincide with the original
bedding. Most usually the 'cleavage,' as this fissile structure
is termed, crosses the bedding at all angles.</p>

<p>25. <i>Crystalline limestone</i> is an altered condition of
common limestone. <i>Saccharoid marble</i> is one of the fine
varieties: it frequently contains flakes of mica. <i>Dolomite</i>,
or magnesian limestone, already described, is probably in
many cases an altered limestone; the carbonate of lime
having been partially dissolved out and replaced by carbonate
of magnesia. <i>Serpentine</i> is also believed by some
geologists to be a highly metamorphosed magnesian
limestone.</p>

<p>26. <i>Schists</i>.&mdash;Under this term comes a great variety of
crystalline rocks which all agree in having a foliated texture&mdash;that
is to say, the constituent minerals are arranged in
layers which usually, but not invariably, coincide with the
original bedding. Amongst the schists come <i>mica-schist</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
(quartz and mica in alternate layers); <i>chlorite-schist</i> (chlorite
with a little quartz, and sometimes with felspar or mica);
<i>talc-schist</i> (talc with quartz or felspar); <i>hornblende schist</i>
(hornblende with a variable quantity of felspar, and sometimes
a little quartz); <i>gneiss</i> (quartz, felspar, and mica).</p>

<p>27. <i>General Character of Metamorphic Rocks.</i>&mdash;All these
rocks betray their aqueous origin by the presence of
more or less distinct lines of bedding. They consist of
various kinds of arenaceous and argillaceous deposits,
which, under the influence of certain metamorphic actions,
to be described in the sequel, have lost their original
granular texture, and become more or less distinctly crystallised.
And not only so, but their chemical ingredients
have in many cases entered into new relations, so as
to give rise to minerals which existed either sparingly or
not at all in the original rocks. Frequently, it is quite
impossible to say what was the original condition of some
metamorphic rocks; often, however, this is sufficiently
obvious. Thus, highly micaceous sandstones, as they are
traced into a metamorphic region, are seen to pass gradually
into mica-schist. When the bedding of gneiss becomes
entirely obliterated, it is often difficult to distinguish that
rock from granite, and in many cases it appears to pass into
a true granite.</p>

<p>28. <i>Granite</i> is a crystalline compound of quartz, felspar
(usually potash-felspar), and mica. Some geologists consider
it to be invariably an igneous rock; but, as just
stated, it sometimes passes into gneiss in such a way as
to lead us to infer its metamorphic origin. There are
certain areas of sandstone in the south of Scotland which
are partially metamorphosed, and in these we may trace a
gradual passage from highly baked felspathic sandstones
with a sub-crystalline texture into a more crystalline rock
which in places graduates into true granite. Granite,
however, also occurs as an igneous rock.</p>

<p>29. <i>Syenite</i> is a crystalline compound of a potash-felspar
and hornblende, and quartz is frequently present. <i>Diorite</i>
is a crystalline aggregate of a soda-felspar and hornblende.
Both syenite and diorite also occur as igneous rocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>
<p>There are a number of other metamorphic rocks, but
those mentioned are the most commonly occurring species.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="IGNEOUS_ROCKS"></a>
<div class="caption3">IGNEOUS ROCKS.</div>

<p>30. <i>Subdivisions.</i>&mdash;In their chemical and mineralogical
composition, igneous rocks offer great variety; but they
all agree in having felspar for their base. They may
be roughly divided into two classes, distinguished by
the relative quantity of silica which they contain. Those
in which the silica ranges from about 50 to 70 or 80
per cent. form what is termed the <i>acidic</i> group; while
those in which the percentage of silica is less constitute
the <i>basic</i> group of igneous rocks, so called because
they contain a large proportion of the heavier
bases, such as <i>magnesia</i>, <i>lime</i>, oxides of iron and manganese,
&amp;c. Igneous rocks vary in texture from homogeneous,
compact, and finely crystalline masses up to
coarsely crystalline aggregates, in which the crystals may
be more than an inch in diameter. Sometimes they are
dull and earthy in texture, at other times vesicular. When
the vesicles are filled up with some mineral, the rock is
said to be <i>amygdaloidal</i>, from the almond shape assumed
by the kernels filling the cavities. When single crystals of
any mineral are scattered through a rock, so as to be
readily distinguished from the compact or crystalline base,
the rock becomes <i>porphyritic</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="caption3">ACIDIC OR FELSPATHIC GROUP.</div>

<p>31. <i>Trachyte</i> (<i>trachys</i>, rough) is a pale or dark-gray rock,
harsh and rough to the touch, in which felspar is the predominant
mineral. It is a common product of eruption in
modern volcanoes.</p>

<p><i>Clinkstone</i> or <i>phonolite</i> is a greenish-gray, compact, felspathic
rock, somewhat slaty or schistose, and weathers
with a white crust. It gives a clear metallic sound under
the hammer. It is a rock not met with among the older
formations of the earth's crust, being confined to Tertiary
(see table, <a href="#GEOLOGICAL_AGES">p. 85</a>) or still more recent times.</p>

<p><i>Obsidian</i> or <i>volcanic glass</i> is usually black, brown, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
green, and usually resembles a coarse bottle-glass. When
it becomes vesicular, it passes gradually into the highly
porous rock called <i>pumice</i>. It is eminently a geologically
modern volcanic rock.</p>

<p><i>Felstone</i> is a reddish-gray, bluish, greenish, or yellowish,
hard, compact, flinty-looking rock, composed of potash-felspar
and silica. It is generally splintery under the
hammer. Some varieties are slaty, and are frequently
mistaken for clinkstone, which they closely resemble.
When the quartz in felstone is distinctly visible either
as grains or crystals, the rock passes into a <i>quartz-porphyry</i>.</p>

<p><i>Granite</i> is recognised as an igneous as well as a metamorphic
rock. Sometimes the veins and dykes which
proceed from or occur near a mass of granite contain no
mica&mdash;this kind of rock is called <i>elvan</i> or <i>elvanite</i>.</p>

<p><i>Porphyrite</i> or <i>felspathite</i> includes a number of rocks
which have a felspathic base, through which felspar crystals
are scattered more or less abundantly. Sometimes hornblende,
or augite, or mica is present. The colour is usually
dark&mdash;some shade of blue, green, red, puce, purple, or
brown&mdash;and the texture varies from compact and finely
crystalline up to coarsely crystalline. Porphyrites are
usually porphyritic, and frequently amygdaloidal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="caption3">AUGITIC AND HORNBLENDIC OR BASIC GROUP.</div>

<p>32. <i>Basalt</i> is a dark or almost black compact homogeneous
rock, composed of felspar and augite with magnetic
iron. An olive-green mineral called <i>olivine</i> is very
frequently present. The coarser-grained basalts are called
<i>dolerite</i>. The columnar structure is not peculiarly characteristic
of basalt. Many basalts are not columnar, and
not a few columnar rocks are not basalts.</p>

<p><i>Greenstone</i> or <i>diorite</i> is usually a dull greenish rock,
sometimes gray, however, speckled with green. It is composed
of soda-felspar and hornblende. The fine-grained
compact greenstones are called <i>aphanite</i>.</p>

<p><i>Syenite</i>, like granite, is recognised as an igneous as well
as a metamorphic rock. There are several other rocks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
which come into the basic group, but those mentioned are
the more common and typical species.</p>

<p>33. <i>Fragmental Igneous Rocks.</i>&mdash;All the igneous rocks
briefly described above are more or less distinctly crystalline
in texture. There is a class of igneous rocks,
however, which do not present this character, but when
fine-grained are dull and earthy in texture, and frequently
consist merely of a rude agglomeration of rough
angular fragments of various rocks. These form the
<span class="smcap">Fragmental</span> group of igneous rocks. The ejectamenta
of loose materials which are thrown out during a volcanic
eruption, consist in chief measure of fragments of
lava, &amp;c. of all sizes, from mere dust, sand, and grit, up to
blocks of more than a ton in weight. These materials, as
we shall afterwards see, are scattered round the orifice of
eruption in more or less irregular beds. The terms applied
to the varieties of ejectamenta found among modern volcanic
accumulations, will be given and explained when we
come to consider the nature of geological agencies. In the
British Islands, and many other non-volcanic regions, we
find besides crystalline igneous rocks, abundant traces of
loose ejectamenta, which clearly prove the former presence
of volcanoes. These materials are sometimes quite amorphous&mdash;that
is to say, they shew no trace of water action&mdash;they
have not been spread out in layers, but consist of rude tumultuous
accumulations of angular and subangular fragments of
igneous rocks. Such masses are termed <i>trappean agglomerate</i>
and <i>trappean breccia</i>. At other times, however, the
ejectamenta give evidence of having been arranged by the
action of water, the materials having been sifted and spread
out in more or less regular layers. What were formerly rude
breccias and agglomerates of angular stones now become
<i>trappean conglomerates</i>&mdash;the stones having been rounded
and water-worn&mdash;while the fine ingredients, the grit, and
sand, and mud, form the rock called <i>trap tuff</i>. Fragmental
rocks are often quite indurated&mdash;the matrix being as hard
as the included stones. But as a rule they are less hard
than crystalline igneous rocks, and in many cases are loose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
and crumbling. When a fragmental rock is composed
chiefly of rocks belonging to the acidic group, we say it is
<i>felspathic</i>. When augitic and hornblendic materials predominate,
then other terms are used; as, for example,
<i>dolerite tuff</i>, <i>greenstone tuff</i>.</p>

<div class="caption3">STRUCTURE AND ARRANGEMENT OF ROCK-MASSES.</div>


<p>34. The student can hardly learn much about the
mineralogical composition of rocks, without at the same
time acquiring some knowledge of the manner of their
occurrence in nature. We have already briefly described
certain sedimentary rocks, such as conglomerate, sandstone,
and shale, and have in some measure touched upon their
structure as rock-masses. These rocks, as we have seen, are
arranged in more or less thick layers or <i>beds</i>, which are piled
one on the top of the other. Rocks which are so arranged
are said to be <i>stratified</i>, and are termed <i>strata</i>. We may
also use the word <i>stratum</i> as an occasional substitute for
<i>bed</i>. The planes of <i>bedding</i> or <i>stratification</i> are sometimes
very close together, in other cases they are wide apart.
When the separate beds are very thin, as in the case of
shale, it is most usual to term them <i>laminæ</i>, and to speak
of the <i>lamination</i> of a shale, as distinguished from the
<i>bedding</i> of a sandstone. Planes of bedding are generally
more strongly marked than planes of lamination. The
laminæ frequently cohere, while beds seldom do. In the
above figure, which represents a vertical cutting or
<i>section</i> through horizontal strata, the planes of lamination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
are shewn at <i>l, l, l</i>, and those of stratification at <i>s, s, s</i>. There
are hardly any limits to the thickness of a bed&mdash;it may
range from an inch up to many feet or yards, while
<i>laminæ</i> vary in thickness from an inch downwards.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>35. Hitherto we have been considering the <i>laminæ</i> and
<i>strata</i> as lying in an approximately horizontal plane. Sometimes,
however, the layers of deposition in a single stratum
are inclined at various angles to themselves, as in the following
figure. This structure is called <i>false bedding</i>; the
layers or laminæ not coinciding with the planes of stratification.
It owes its origin to shifting currents, such as the ebb
and flow of the tide, and very often characterises deposits
which have been formed in shallow water. (Hillocks of
drifting sand frequently shew a similar structure, but their
false bedding is, as a rule, much more pronounced.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>36. <i>Mud-cracks and Rain-prints.</i>&mdash;The surfaces of some
beds occasionally exhibit markings closely resembling those
seen upon a flat sandy beach after the retreat of the tide&mdash;hence
they are called <i>ripple-marks</i> or <i>current-marks</i>. They
are, of course, due to the gentle current action which pushes
along the grains of sand, and hence, such marks may be
formed wherever a current sweeps over the bottom of the
sea with energy just sufficient for the purpose. But since
the necessary conditions for the formation of <i>ripple-mark</i>
occur most abundantly in shallow water, its frequent
appearance in a series of strata may often be taken as
evidence, so far, for the shallow-water origin of the beds.
Besides ripple-marks we may also detect occasionally on
the surfaces of certain strata <i>mud-cracks</i> and <i>rain-prints</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
These occur most commonly in fine-grained beds, as in
flagstones, argillaceous sandstones, shales, &amp;c. The <i>mud-cracks</i>
resemble those upon a mud-flat which are caused by
the desiccation and consequent shrinkage of the mud when
exposed to the sun. The old cracks have been subsequently
filled up again by a deposition of mud or sand, usually of
harder consistency than the rock traversed by the cracks.
Hence, when the bed that overlies the mud-cracks is
removed, we find a cast of these projecting from its under
surface, or frequently the cast remains in its mould, and
forms a series of curious ridges ramifying over the whole
surface of the old mud-flat. <i>Rain-prints</i> are the small pits
caused by the impact of large drops. They are usually
deeper at one side than the other, from which we can infer
the direction of the wind at the time the rain-drops fell.
Like the mud-cracks, they are most commonly met with in
fine-grained beds, and have been preserved in a similar
manner. Some geologists have also been able to detect
<i>wave-marks</i>, 'faint outlinings of curved form on a sandstone
layer, like the outline left by a wave along the limit where it
dies out upon a beach.'</p>

<p>37. <i>Succession of Strata.</i>&mdash;The succession of strata is
often very diversified. Thus, we may observe in one and
the same section numberless alternating beds of sandstone
and shale from an inch or so up to several feet each in
thickness, with seams of coal, fireclay, ironstone, and limestone
interstratified among them. In other cases, again,
the succession is simpler, and some deep quarries shew
only one bed, as is the case with certain limestones, fine-grained
sandstones (liver-rock), and many volcanic rocks.
Some limestones, indeed, shew small trace of bedding
throughout a vertical thickness of hundreds of feet.</p>

<p>38. <i>Beds, their Extent, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;Beds of rock are not only of
very different thicknesses, but they are also of very variable
extent. Some may thin gradually away, or 'die out' suddenly,
in a few feet or yards, while others may extend over many
square miles. Beds of limestone, for example, can often be
traced for leagues in several directions; and if this be the
case with certain single beds, it is still more true of groups
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
of strata. Thus the coal-bearing strata belonging to what
is called the Carboniferous period cover large areas in
Wales, England, Scotland, and Ireland, not less, probably,
than 6000 square miles; and strata belonging to the
same great period spread over considerable tracts on the
Continent, and a very extensive area in North America. It
holds generally true that beds of fine-grained materials are
not only of more equal thickness throughout, but have also
a wider extension than coarser-grained rocks. Fine sandstones,
for example, extend over a wider area, and preserve
a more equable thickness throughout than conglomerates,
while limestones and coals are more continuous than
either.</p>

<p>39. When a bed is followed for any distance it is frequently
found to thin away, and give place to another occupying
the same plane or <i>horizon</i>. Thus a shale will be replaced
by a sandstone, a sandstone by a conglomerate, and <i>vice
versâ</i>. Sometimes also we may find a shale, as we trace it
in some particular direction, gradually becoming charged
with calcareous matter, so as by and by to pass, as it were,
into limestone. Every bed must, of course, end somewhere,
either by thus gradually passing into another, or by thinning
out so as to allow beds which immediately overlie and
underlie it to come together. Not unfrequently, however, a
bed will stop abruptly, as in <a href="#fig_3">fig. 3</a>.</p>

</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>40. <i>Sequence of Beds.</i>&mdash;It requires little reflection to see
that the division plane between two beds may represent
a very long period of time. Let the following diagram
represent a section of strata, <i>s</i> being beds of grit, and
<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, beds of sandstone and shale. It is evident that
the beds s must have been formed before the strata <i>b</i>
were deposited above them. At ×, the beds <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
come together, and were attention to be confined to that
part of the section, the observer might be led to infer
that no great space of time elapsed between the deposition
of these two beds. Yet we see that an interval sufficient
to allow of the formation of the beds <i>s</i> must really
have intervened. It is now well known that in many cases
planes of bedding represent 'breaks in the succession' of
strata&mdash;'breaks' which are often the equivalents of considerable
thicknesses of strata. In one place, for example, we may
have an apparently complete sequence of beds, as <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>,
which a more extended knowledge of the same beds, as
these are developed in some other locality, enables us to
supplement, as <i>a</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>.</p>

<p>41. <i>Joints.</i>&mdash;Besides <i>planes</i> or <i>lines of bedding</i>, there are
certain other division planes or <i>joints</i> by which rocks are
intersected. The former, as we have seen, are congenital;
the latter are subsequent. Joints cut right across the
bedding, and are often variously combined, one set of joint
planes traversing the rock in one direction, and another set
or sets intersecting these at various angles. Thus, in many
cases the rocks are so divided as easily to separate into
more or less irregular fragments of various sizes. Besides
these confused joints there are usually other more regular
division planes, which intersect the strata in some definite
directions, and run parallel to each other, often over a wide
area: these are called <i>master-joints</i>. Two sets of master-joints
may intersect the same strata, and when such is the
case, the rock may be quarried in cuboidal blocks, the size
of which will vary, of course, according as the two sets of
joints are near or wide apart. Joints may either gape or be
quite close; so close, indeed, as in many cases to be invisible
to the naked eye. Certain igneous rocks frequently shew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
division planes which meet each other in such a way as to
form a series of polygonal prisms. The basalt of Staffa and
Giants' Causeway are familiar examples of this structure.
Jointing is due to the gradual consolidation of the strata,
and hence, in a series of strata, we may find the separate
beds, according to their composition, very variously affected,
some being much more abundantly jointed than others.
Master-joints which traverse a wide district in some definite
direction probably owe their origin to tension, the strata
having been subjected to some strain by the underground
forces.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>42. <i>Cleavage.</i>&mdash;Fine-grained rocks, more especially those
which are argillaceous, occasionally shew another kind of
structure, which is called <i>cleavage</i>. Common clay-slate is a
type of the structure. This rock splits up into innumerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
thin laminæ or plates, the surface of which may either be
somewhat rough, or as smooth nearly as glass. The cleavage
planes, however, need not be parallel with the planes of bedding;
in most cases, indeed, they cut right across these, and
continue parallel to each other often over a very wide region.
The original bedding is sometimes entirely obliterated, and
in most cases of well-defined cleavage is always more or
less obscure.</p>

<p>In the preceding diagram, the general phenomena of
<i>bedding</i>, <i>jointing</i>, and <i>cleavage</i> are represented. The lines
of bedding are shewn at S, S; another set of division-planes
(joints) is observed at J, J, intersecting the former at right
angles&mdash;A, B, C being the exposed faces of joints. The
lines of cleavage are seen at D, D, cutting across the planes
of bedding and jointing.</p>

<p>43. <i>Foliation</i> is another kind of superinduced structure.
In a foliated rock the mineral ingredients have been crystallised
and arranged in layers along either the planes of
original bedding or those of cleavage. Mica-schist and
gneiss are typical examples.</p>

<p>44. <i>Concretions.</i>&mdash;In many rocks a concretionary structure
may be observed. Some sandstones and shales appear
as if made up of spheroidal masses, the mineral composition
of the spheroids not differing apparently from that of the
unchanged rock. So in some kinds of limestone, as in
<i>dolomite</i>, the concretionary structure is often highly developed,
the rock resembling now irregular heaps of turnips
with finger-and-toe disease, again, piles of cannon-balls, or
bunches of grapes, and agglomerations of musket-shot. A
spheroidal structure is occasionally met with amongst some
igneous rocks. This is well seen in the case of rocks having
the basaltic structure, in which the pillars, being jointed
transversely, decompose along their division planes, so as to
form irregular globular masses. In many cases, certain
mineral matter which was originally diffused through a rock
has segregated so as to form nodules and irregular layers.
Examples of this are <i>chert</i> nodules in limestone; <i>flint</i>
nodules in chalk; <i>clay-ironstone</i> balls in shale, &amp;c.</p>

<p>45. <i>Inclination of Strata.</i>&mdash;Beds of aqueous strata must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
have been deposited in horizontal or approximately horizontal
planes; but we now find them most frequently inclined at
various angles to the horizon, and often even standing
on end. They sometimes, however, retain a horizontal
position over a large tract of country. The angle which the
inclined strata make with the horizon is called the <i>dip</i>, the
degree of inclination being the <i>amount</i> of the dip; and
a line drawn at right angles to the dip is called the <i>strike</i> of
the beds. Thus, a bed dipping south-west will have a north-west
and south-east strike. The <i>crop</i> or <i>outcrop</i> (sometimes
also, but rarely, called the <i>basset edge</i>) of a bed is the place
where the edge of the stratum comes to view at the surface.
We may look upon inclined beds as being merely parts of
more or less extensive undulations of strata, the tops of the
undulations having been removed so as to expose the
truncated edges of the beds. In the following diagram, for
example, the outcrops of limestone seen at <i>l</i>, <i>l</i>, are evidently
portions of one and the same stratum, the dotted lines indicating
its former extent. The trough-shaped arrangement
of the beds at <i>s</i> is called a <i>synclinal curve</i>, or simply a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
syncline; the arched strata at <i>a</i> forming, on the contrary,
an <i>anticlinal curve</i> or <i>anticline</i>.</p>

<p>When strata shew many and rapid curves, they are said
to be contorted. The diagram section (<a href="#fig_10">fig. 10</a>) will best
explain what is meant by this kind of structure.</p>

<p>46. In certain regions, the strata often dip in one
and the same direction for many miles, at an angle
approaching verticality, as in the following section. It
might be inferred, therefore, that from A to B we had
a gradually ascending series&mdash;that as we paced over the
outcrop we were stepping constantly from a lower to a
higher geological horizon. But, in such cases, the dip is
deceptive, the same beds being repeated again and again
in a series of great foldings of the strata. Such is the case
over wide areas in the upland districts of the south of Scotland.
The section (<a href="#fig_11">fig. 11</a>) shews that the beds are actually
inverted, the strata at × × being bent back upon strata
which really overlie them.</p>

<p>47. <i>Contemporaneous Erosion.</i>&mdash;Occasionally a group of
strata gives proof that pauses in the deposition of sediment
took place, during which running water scooped out of the
sediment channels of greater or less width, which subsequently
became filled up with similar or dissimilar materials.
The diagram (<a href="#fig_12">fig. 12</a>) will render this plain. At <i>a</i> we have
beds of sandstone, which it is evident were at one time
throughout as thick as they still are at × ×. Having been
worn away to the extent indicated, a deposition of clay (<i>b</i>)
succeeded; and this, in turn, became eroded at <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, the
hollows being filled up again with coarse sand and gravel.
In former paragraphs, we found reason to believe that lines
of bedding indicated certain pauses in the deposition of
strata. Here, in the present case, we have more ample
proof in the same direction.</p>

</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>48. <i>Unconformability.</i>&mdash;But the most striking evidence of
such pauses in the deposition of strata is afforded by the
phenomenon called <i>unconformability</i>. When one set of
rocks is found resting on the upturned edges of a lower set,
the former are said to be <i>unconformable</i> to the latter. In
the above section (<a href="#fig_13">fig. 13</a>), <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, are beds of sandstone
resting on the upturned edges of beds of limestone, shale,
and sandstone, <i>l</i>, <i>s</i>. <a href="#fig_14">Figs. 14</a> <a href="#fig_15">and 15</a> give other examples
of the same appearance. It is evident that, in the case of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
<a href="#fig_14">fig. 14</a>, the discordant bedding chronicles the lapse of a very
long period. We have to conceive first of the deposition
of the underlying strata in horizontal or approximately
horizontal layers; then we have to think of the time when
they were crumpled up into great convolutions, and the tops
of the convolutions (the anticlines) were planed away: all
these changes intervened, of course, after the lower set was
deposited, and before the upper series was laid down. In
the case represented in <a href="#fig_15">fig. 15</a>, we have a double unconformability,
implying a still more elaborate series of changes, and
probably, therefore, a still longer lapse of time.</p>

<p>49. <i>Overlap.</i>&mdash;When the upper beds of a conformable
group of strata spread over a wider area than the lower
members of the same series, they are said to <i>overlap</i>. The
accompanying diagram shews this appearance. An overlap
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
proves that a gradual submergence of the land was going on
at the time the strata were being accumulated. As the land
disappeared below the water, the sediment gradually spread
over a wider area, the more recently deposited sediment
being laid down in places which existed as dry land at the
time when the earliest accumulations were formed. Thus,
in the accompanying illustration (<a href="#fig_16">fig. 16</a>), the stratum
marked 1, resting unconformably upon older strata, is
overlapped by 2, as that is by 3, and so on&mdash;all the beds
in succession coming to repose upon the older strata at
higher and higher levels, as the old land subsided.</p>

<p>50. <i>Dislocations or Faults.</i>&mdash;When strata, once continuous,
have been broken across, and displaced or shifted along the
line of breakage, they are said to be <i>faulted</i>, the fissure
along which the displacement occurs being termed a <i>fault</i>
or <i>dislocation</i>. The simplest form of a fault is that shewn
in the following diagram, where strata of sandstone and
shale, with a coal-seam, S, have been shifted along the line
<i>f</i>. The direction in which the <i>fault</i> is inclined<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> is its <i>hade</i>,
and the degree of <i>vertical displacement</i> of the beds is the
<i>amount</i> of the dislocation. Generally, the beds seem to be
pulled <i>down</i> in the direction of the <i>downthrow</i>, and <i>drawn
up</i> on the opposite side of the fault, as shewn in the diagram.
Sometimes the rocks on each side of a fault are smoothed
and polished, and covered with long scratches, as if the two
sides of the fissure had been rubbed together. This is the
appearance called <i>slickensides</i>. Slickensides, however, may
occur on the walls of a fissure which is not a displacement,
but a mere joint or crack. A dislocation is spoken of as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
downthrow or an upcast, according to the direction in which
it is approached. Thus, a miner working along the coal-seam
S, from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>, would describe the fault, <i>f</i>, as an <i>upcast</i>,
since he would have to mine to a <i>higher</i> level to catch his
coal again. But, had he approached the fault from <i>c</i> to <i>d</i>,
he would then have termed it a <i>downthrow</i>, because he
would see from the hade of the fault that his coal-seam must
be sought for at a <i>lower</i> level. Faults are of all sizes, from
a foot or two up to vertical displacements of thousands of
feet. Powerful dislocations can often be followed for many
miles across a country, running in a more or less linear
direction. Thus, one large fault has been traced across the
breadth of Scotland, from near St Abb's Head, in the east,
to the coast of Wigtown, in the west. Every large throw is
accompanied by a number of smaller ones&mdash;some of which
run parallel to the main fault, while many others seem to
run out from this at various angles. Faults are of all
geological ages. Some date back to a most remote antiquity,
others are of quite recent origin; and no doubt faults
are occurring even now. In the following diagram, the
strata, <i>a, a</i>, have been faulted and planed away before the
strata, <i>b</i>, were deposited. Hence, in this case, it is evident
that if we know the geological age of the beds, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, we
can have an approximation to the age of the fault. If the
beds, <i>a</i>, be Carboniferous, and those at <i>b</i> Permian, then we
should say the fault was <i>post-Carboniferous</i> or <i>pre-Permian</i>.</p>

<p>51. <i>Metamorphic and Igneous Rocks&mdash;mode of their occurrence.</i>&mdash;In
the foregoing remarks on the structure and
arrangement of rocks we have had reference chiefly to the
aqueous strata&mdash;that is to say, the <i>mechanically</i>, <i>chemically</i>,
and <i>organically</i> formed rocks. We were necessarily compelled,
however, to make some reference to, and to give
some description of, certain structures and arrangements
which are not peculiar to aqueous strata, but characterise
many metamorphic and igneous rocks as well. To avoid
repetition it was also necessary, while treating of <i>joints</i>, &amp;c.,
to give some account of certain structures which are the
result of metamorphic action. But, for sake of clearness, we
have reserved special account of the structure and mode of
occurrence of metamorphic and igneous rocks to this place.
After what has been said as to the structure and arrangement
of aqueous strata, it is hardly needful to say much
about the crystalline schists. These the student will understand
to be merely highly altered aqueous rocks,<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> in which

the marks of their origin are still more or less distinctly
traceable. As a rule, metamorphic strata are contorted,
twisted, and crumpled, although here and there comparatively
horizontal stretches of altered rocks may be observed.
The regions in which they occur are often hilly and mountainous,
but this is by no means invariably the case. The
greater part of the mountainous regions of the British
Islands is occupied by rocks which are more or less altered;
the more crystalline rocks, such as mica-schist, gneiss, &amp;c.,
being abundantly developed in the Scottish Highlands, and
in the north and west of Ireland; while those which are less
altered cover large areas in the south of Scotland, and in
Wales and the north-west of England. Throughout these
wide areas the rocks generally dip at high angles, and contortion
and crumpling are of common occurrence. The finer-grained
clay-rocks also exhibit fine cleavage planes, and
are in some places quarried for roofing-slates&mdash;the Welsh
quarries being the most famous. Here and there, bedding
is entirely effaced, and the resulting rock is quite amorphous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and, becoming gradually more and more crystalline, passes
at last into a rock which in many cases is true granite. The
original strata have disappeared, and granite occupies their
place, in such a way as to lead to the inference that the
granite is merely the aqueous strata which have been fused
up, as it were, <i>in situ</i>. At other times the granite would
appear to have been erupted amongst the aqueous strata,
for these are highly confused, and baked, as it were, at their
junction with the granite, from which, also, long veins are
seen protruding into the surrounding beds. Metamorphic
granite, then, graduates, as a rule, almost imperceptibly into
rocks which are clearly of aqueous origin; while on the
contrary the junction-line between igneous granite and the
surrounding rocks is always well marked. The origin of
granite, however, is a difficult question, and one which has
given rise to much discussion. Some further remarks upon
the subject will be found in the sequel under the heading of
<i>Metamorphism</i>.</p>

<p>52. True <i>igneous rocks</i> occur either in beds or as irregular
amorphous masses. When they occur as beds interstratified
with aqueous strata, they are said to be <i>contemporaneous</i>,
because they have evidently been erupted at the time the
series of strata among which they appear was being
amassed. When, on the other hand, they cut across the
bedding, they are said to be <i>subsequent</i> or <i>intrusive</i>, because
in this case they have been formed at a period <i>subsequent</i>
to the strata among which they have been <i>intruded</i>. The bed
upon which a contemporaneous igneous rock reclines, often
affords marks of having been subjected to the action of heat;
sandstones being hardened, and frequently much jointed and
cracked, owing to the shrinking induced by the heat of the
once molten rock above, and clay-rocks often assuming
a baked appearance. There is generally, also, some discoloration
both in the pavement of rock upon which the
igneous mass lies, and in the under portions of the latter
itself. The beds overlying a contemporaneous igneous
rock, however, do not exhibit any marks of the action of
heat; the old lava-stream having cooled before the sediment,
now forming the overlying strata, was accumulated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
over its surface. One may often notice how the sand and
mud have quietly settled down into the irregular hollows and
crevices of the old lava, as in the following section, where
<i>i</i> represents the igneous rock; <i>a</i> being the baked pavement
of sandstone, &amp;c.; and <i>b</i> the overlying sedimentary deposits.
When the igneous rock itself is examined, its upper portions
are often observed to be scoriaceous or cinder-like, and the
under portions likewise frequently exhibit a similar appearance.
It is generally most solid towards the centre of the
bed. The vesicles, or pores, in the upper and lower portions
are often flattened, and are frequently filled with mineral
matter. Sometimes these cavities may have been filled
at the time the rock was being erupted, but in most cases
the mineral matter would appear to have been introduced
subsequently by the action of water percolating through the
rock. Occasionally we meet with igneous rocks which are
more or less vesicular and amygdaloidal throughout their
entire mass. Others, again, often shew no vesicular structure,
but are homogeneous from top to bottom. The texture is
also very variable, and this even in the same rock-mass;
some portions being compact or fine-grained, and others
coarsely crystalline. As a rule the rock is most crystalline
towards the centre, and gets finer-grained as the top and
bottom of the bed are approached. Not unfrequently, however,
an igneous rock will preserve the same texture throughout.
The jointing is also highly irregular as a rule. But in
many cases, especially when the rock is fine-grained, the
jointing is very regular. The basaltic columns of the Giants'
Causeway and the Isle of Staffa are well-known examples
of such regularly jointed masses. Igneous rocks frequently
decompose into a loose earthy mass (<i>wacké</i>), and this is most
markedly the case with those belonging to the basic group.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>
<p>53. Contemporaneous igneous rocks are frequently associated
with more or less regular beds of <i>breccia</i>, <i>conglomerate</i>,
<i>ash</i>, <i>tuff</i>, &amp;c. These are evidently the loose volcanic ejectamenta
which accompanied former eruptions of lava, and
have been arranged by the action of water. Beds of such
materials, however, frequently occur without any accompanying
lava-form rocks. Nor are they always arranged in bedded
masses. They sometimes appear filling vertical pipes which
seem to have been the funnels of old volcanoes. The following
section exhibits the general appearance of one of
these volcanic <i>necks</i>. They are very common in some parts
of Scotland, as in Ayrshire, and are frequently ranged along
the line of a fault in the strata. <a href="#fig_21">Fig. 21</a> shews such a neck of
ejectamenta, made up of fragments of various kinds of rock,
such as sandstone, shale, limestone, coal, &amp;c., sometimes
without any admixture of igneous rocks. The strata
through which the pipe has been pierced usually dip in
towards the latter, and at their junction with the coarse
agglomerate often shew marks of the action of heat, coal-seams
having sometimes been 'burned' useless for a number
of yards away from the 'neck.'</p>

<p>54. Intrusive igneous rocks occur as <i>sheets</i>, <i>dykes</i>, and
<i>necks</i>. The sheets frequently conform for long distances to
the bedding of the strata among which they occur, and are
thus liable to be mistaken for contemporaneous rocks. But
when they are closely examined, it will be seen that they
not only bake or alter the beds above and below them, but
seldom keep precisely to one horizon or level&mdash;occasionally
rising to a higher, or sinking to a lower position in the
strata, as shewn in the following diagram-section. Dykes are
wall-like masses of igneous strata which cut across the strata,
generally at a high angle (see <i>d, d</i>, <a href="#fig_22">fig. 22</a>). In the neighbourhood
of a recent volcanic orifice, numerous dykes are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
seen ramifying in all directions. In the British Islands
some dykes have been followed in a linear direction for
very long distances. Sometimes these occupy the sites of
large dislocations, at other times they have cut through the
strata without displacing them. Occasionally they appear
to have been the feeders of the great sheets of igneous rock
which here and there occur in their vicinity. The phenomena
presented by the <i>necks</i> of intrusive rock do not
differ from those characteristic of <i>agglomerate</i> or <i>tuff necks</i>.
The strata are bent down towards the central plug of igneous
rock, and are generally more or less altered at the line of
junction.</p>

<p>55. Intrusive rocks offer, as a rule, some contrasts in
texture to contemporaneous masses. They are seldom
amygdaloidal, but when they are so it is generally towards
the centre of the mass. The kernels are usually minute and
more or less spherical.</p>

<p>The diagram (<a href="#fig_23">fig. 23</a>) shews the general mode of occurrence
of igneous rocks on the large scale. The stratified
aqueous deposits are indicated at <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>. These are overlaid
by a series of alternating beds of crystalline (<i>c</i>) and fragmental
(<i>t</i>) igneous rocks. An irregular intrusive sheet at <i>i</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
cuts across the beds <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>. At <i>p</i>, another intrusive mass is
seen rising in a pipe, as it were, and overflowing the beds
<i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, so as to form a cap. A volcanic neck filled with
angular stones intersects the strata at <i>n</i>, and two dykes,
approaching the vertical, traverse the bedded rocks at
<i>d</i>, <i>d</i>. It will be noticed that the contemporaneous igneous
rocks form a series of escarpments rising one above the
other.</p>

<p>The alteration effected by igneous rocks is generally
greatest in the case of intrusive masses. This is well
seen in some of our coal-fields, where the coal has
frequently been destroyed over large areas by the proximity
of masses of what was once melted rock. It is curious to
notice how the intrusive sheets in a great series of strata
have forced their way along the lines of least resistance.
Thus, in the Scottish coal-fields, we find again and again that
intrusive sheets have been squirted along the planes occupied
by coal-seams, these having been more easily attacked than
beds of sandstone or shale. The coal in such cases is either
entirely 'eaten up,' as it were, or converted into a black soot.
At other times, however, it is changed into a kind of coke,
while other seams at a greater distance from the intrusive
mass have been altered into a kind of 'blind coal' or <i>anthracite</i>.</p>

<p>These remarks on the mode of occurrence of igneous
rocks are meant to refer chiefly to those masses which occur
in regions where volcanic action has long been extinct, as,
for instance, in the British Islands. In the sequel, some
account will be given of the appearances presented by
modern volcanoes and volcanic rocks.</p>

<div class="smaller">
  <p>* It has been usual to apply the term <i>trap</i> or <i>trappean</i> rock to all the old igneous rocks which could neither be classed with the granites and syenites, nor yet with the recent lavas, &amp;c., which are connected with a more or less well-marked volcanic vent. The term <i>trap</i> (Swedish <i>trappa</i>, a flight of steps) was suggested by the terraced or step-like appearance presented by hills which are built up of successive beds of igneous rock. But the passage from the granitic into the so-called trap rocks, and from these into the distinctly volcanic, is so very gradual, that it is impossible to say where the one class ends and the other begins. The term <i>trap</i>, therefore, has no scientific precision, although it is sometimes very convenient as a kind of broad generic term to include a large number of rocks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>
<div class="caption3">MINERAL VEINS.</div>

<p>56. The cracks and crevices and joint planes which
intersect all rocks in a greater or less degree, are not
unfrequently filled with subsequently introduced mineral
matter, forming what are termed <i>veins</i>. This introduced
matter may either be harder or less durable than the rock
itself; in the former case, the veins will project from
the surface of the stone, where that has been subjected
to the weathering action of the atmosphere; in the latter
case, the veins, under like circumstances, are often partially
emptied of their mineral matter. Not unfrequently, however,
the more or less irregularly ramifying, non-metalliferous
veins appear as if they had segregated from the
body of the rock in which they occur, as in the case of
the quartz veins in granite. Besides these irregular veins,
the rocks of certain districts are traversed in one or
more determinate directions by fissures, extending from the
surface down to unknown depths. These great fissures are
often in like manner filled with mineral matter. The
minerals are usually arranged in bands or layers which
run parallel to the walls of the vein. Quartz, fluor-spar,
barytes, calcite, &amp;c. are among the commonest vein-minerals,
and with these are frequently associated ores
of various metals. A vein may vary in width from less
than an inch up to many yards, and the arrangement of its
contents is also subject to much variation. Instead of
parallel layers of spars and ores, frequently a confused
mass of clay and broken rocks, which are often cemented
together with sparry matter, chokes up the vein. The ore
in a vein may occur in one or more ribs, which often vary
in thickness from a mere line up to masses several yards in
width. Sometimes the rocks are dislocated along the line
of fissure occupied by a great vein; at other times no
dislocation can be observed. Mineral veins, however, do
not necessarily occupy dislocation fissures. They often
occur in cavities which have been formed by the erosive
action of acidulated water, in the way described in pars. <a href="#numb_59">59</a>,
<a href="#numb_60">60</a>, and <a href="#numb_61">61</a>. This is frequently the case in calcareous strata.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Such veins usually coincide more or less with the bedding
of the rocks, but in the case of thick limestones they not
unfrequently cut across the bedding in a vertical or nearly
vertical direction, forming what are termed <i>pipe-veins</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>57. Having considered the composition, structure, and
arrangement of the rock-masses which form the solid crust
of our globe, we have next to inquire into the nature of those
physical agencies by the action of which the rocks, as we
now see them, have been produced. The work performed
by the various forces employed in modifying the earth's
crust is at one and the same time destructive and reconstructive.
Rocks are being continually demolished, and out of
their ruins new rocks are being built. In other words,
matter is constantly entering into new relations&mdash;now existing
as solid rock, or in solution in water, or carried as the
lightest dust on the wings of the wind; now being swept
down by rivers into the sea, or brought under the influence
of subterranean heat&mdash;but always changing, sooner or later,
slowly or rapidly, from one form to another. The great
geological agents of change are these: 1. <span class="smcap">The Atmosphere</span>;
2. <span class="smcap">Water</span>; 3. <span class="smcap">Plants and Animals</span>; 4. <span class="smcap">Subterranean
Forces</span>. We shall consider these in succession.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="THE_ATMOSPHERE"></a>
<div class="caption3">THE ATMOSPHERE.</div>

<p>58. All rocks have a tendency to waste away under the
influence of the atmosphere. This is termed <i>weathering</i>.
Under the influence of the sun's heat, the external portions of
a rock expand, and again contract when they cool at night.
The effect of this alternate expansion and contraction is
often strikingly manifest in tropical countries: some rocks
being gradually disintegrated, and crumbling into grit
and sand; others becoming cracked, and either exfoliating
or breaking up all over their surface into small angular fragments.
Again, in countries subject to alternations of extreme
heat and cold, similar weathering action takes place. The
chemical action of the atmosphere is most observable in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
case of calcareous rocks. The carbonic acid almost invariably
present acts as a solvent, so that dew and rain, which
otherwise would in many cases have but feeble disintegrating
power, are enabled to eat into such rocks as chalk and
limestone, calcareous sandstones, &amp;c. The oxygen of the
atmosphere also unites with certain minerals, such as the
proto-salts of iron, and converts them into peroxides. It is
this action which produces the red and yellow ferruginous
discolorations in sandstone. Chemical changes also take
place in the case of many igneous rocks, the result being
that a weathered 'crust' forms wherever such rocks are
exposed to the action of the atmosphere. Of course, the
rate at which a rock weathers depends upon its mineralogical
and chemical composition. Limestones weather much
more rapidly than clay-rocks; and augitic igneous rocks, as
a rule, disintegrate more readily than the more highly silicated
species. The weathering action of the atmosphere
is also greatly aided by frost, as we shall see presently.
The result of all this weathering is the formation of <i>soil</i>&mdash;soil
being only the fine-grained débris of the weathered
rocks. The angular débris found at the base of all cliffs in
temperate and arctic regions, and on every hill and mountain
which is subjected to alternations of extreme heat and
cold, is also the effect of weathering. But these and other
effects of frost will be treated of under the head of <i>Frozen
Water</i>. The hillocks and ridges of loose sand (<i>sand
dunes</i>) found in many places along the sea-margin, and
even in the interior of some continents, as in Africa and
Asia, are due to the action of the wind, which drives the
loose grains before it, and piles them up. Sometimes also
the wind carries in suspension the finest dust, which may
be transported for vast distances before it falls to the
ground. Thus, fine dust shot into the air by the volcanoes
of Iceland has been blown as far as the Shetland Islands;
and in tropical countries the dust of the dried-up and
parched beds of lakes and rivers is often swept away during
hurricanes, and carried in thick clouds for leagues. Rain
falling through this dust soaks it up, and comes down
highly discoloured, brown and red. This is the so-called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
<i>blood-rain</i>. Minute microscopic animal and vegetable
organisms are often commingled with this dust, and falling
into streams, lakes, or the sea, may thus become eventually
buried in sediments very far removed from the place that
gave them birth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="WATER"></a>
<div class="caption3">WATER.</div>

<a name="numb_59"></a>
<p>59. The geological action of water in modifying the crust
of the earth is twofold&mdash;namely, <i>chemical</i> and <i>mechanical</i>.</p>

<p><i>Underground Water.</i>&mdash;All the moisture which we see
falling as rain or snow does not flow immediately away by
brooks and rivers to the sea. Some portion of it soaks into the
ground, and finds a passage for itself by cracks and fissures
in the rocks below, from which it emerges at last as springs,
either at the surface of the earth, or at the bottom of the
sea. Such are the more obvious courses pursued by the
water&mdash;it flows off either by sub-aërial or subterranean
channels. But a not inconsiderable portion soaks into the
solid rocks themselves, which are all more or less porous
and pervious. Water thus slowly soaking often effects very
considerable chemical changes. Sometimes the binding
matter which held the separate particles of the rock together
is dissolved out, and the rock is thus rendered soft and
crumbling; at other times, the reverse takes place, and the
water deposits, in the minute interstitial pores, some binding
matter by which the partially or wholly incoherent grains
are agglutinated into a solid mass. Thus what were originally
hard and tough rocks become disintegrated to such a
degree, that they crumble to powder soon after they are
exposed to the air; while some again are converted into a
clay, and may be dug readily with a spade. And, on the
other hand, loose sand is glued into a hard building-stone.
There are many other changes effected upon rocks by water,
in virtue of the chemical agents which it holds in solution.
Indeed, it may be said that there are very few, if any, rocks
in which the chemical action of interstitial water has not
formerly been, or is not at present being, carried on.
Besides that which soaks through the rocks themselves,
there is always a large proportion of underground water,
which, as we have said above, finds a circuitous route for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
itself by joints, cracks, and crevices. After coursing for, it
may be, miles underground, such water eventually emerges
as springs, which contain in solution the various ingredients
which the water has chemically extracted from the rocks.
These ingredients are then deposited in proportion as the
mineral water suffers from evaporation. Water impregnated
with carbonate of lime, for example, deposits that compound
as soon as evaporation has carried off a certain percentage
of the water itself, and the carbonic acid gas which it held.
This is the origin of the mineral called <i>travertine</i> or <i>calcareous
tufa</i>, which is so commonly met with on the margins
of springs, rivers, and waterfalls.</p>

<a name="numb_60"></a>
<p>60. <i>Stalactites</i> and <i>stalagmites</i> have been formed in a similar
way. Water slowly oozing from the roof of a limestone
cavern partially evaporates there, and a thin pellicle of
carbonate of lime is formed; while that portion of the water
which falls to the ground, and is there evaporated, likewise
gives rise to the formation of carbonate of lime. By such
constant dropping and evaporating, long tongue-and icicle-like
pendants (<i>stalactites</i>) grow downwards from the roof;
while at the same time domes and bosses (<i>stalagmites</i>) grow
upwards from the floor, so as sometimes to meet the former
and give rise to continuous pillars and columns. The great
solvent power of carbonated water is shewn first by the
chemical analysis of springs, and, secondly, by the great wasting
effects which the long-continued action of these has
brought about. Thus, it has been estimated that the fifty
springs near Carlsbad, which yield eight hundred thousand
cubic feet of water in twenty-four hours, contain in solution
as much lime as would go to form a mass of stone weighing
two hundred thousand pounds. Warm, or, as they are
termed, <i>thermal</i> springs, frequently carry away with them,
out of the bowels of the earth, vast quantities of mineral
matter in solution. The waters at Bath, for instance, are
estimated to bring to the surface an annual amount of
various salts, the mass of which is not less than 554
cubic yards. One of the springs of Louèche, France, however,
carries out with it no less than 8,822,400 pounds of
gypsum annually, which is equal to about 2122 cubic yards.</p>

<a name="numb_61"></a>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>
<p>61. It is easy to conceive, therefore, that in the course of
ages great alterations must be caused by springs. Caves
and winding galleries, and irregular channels, will be worn
out of the rocks which are thus being dissolved. Especially
will this be the case in countries where calcareous rocks
abound. It is in such regions, accordingly, where we meet
with the most striking examples of caves and underground
river-channels. The largest cave at present known is the
Mammoth Cave, in Kentucky. This remarkable hollow
consists of numerous winding galleries and passages that
cross and recross, and the united length of which is
said to be 217 miles. In calcareous countries, rivers,
after flowing for, it may be, miles at the surface, suddenly
disappear into the ground, and flow often for long distances
before they reappear in the light of day. In
some regions, indeed, nearly all the drainage is subterranean.
The surface of the ground, in calcareous countries,
frequently shews circular depressions, caused by the falling
in of the roofs of caverns. Sometimes, also, great masses
of rock, often miles in extent, get loosened by the dissolving
action of subterranean water, and crash downwards into
the valleys. Such <i>landslips</i>, as they are called, are not,
however, confined to calcareous regions. In 1806, a large
section of the Rossberg, a mountain lying to the north of
the Righi, consisting of conglomerate overlying beds of
clay, rushed down into the plains of Goldau, overwhelming
four villages and nearly a thousand inhabitants.
The cause of this catastrophe was undoubtedly the softening
into mud of the clay-beds on which the conglomerate
rested, for the season which had just terminated
when the slip took place had been very wet. The mass
of material that slid down was estimated to contain
upwards of fifty-four millions of cubic yards; it reached
not less than two and a half miles in length, by some
three hundred and fifty yards wide, and thirty-five yards thick.</p>

<p>62. <i>Surface-water&mdash;Rain.</i>&mdash;Having now learned something
as to the modifications produced by underground
water, we turn next to consider the action of surface-water,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
and the results arising from that action. Rain, when it
falls to the ground, carries with it some carbonic acid gas
which it has absorbed from the atmosphere. Armed with
this solvent, it attacks certain rocks, more especially limestones
and chalk, a certain proportion of which it licks up
and delivers over to brooks and streams. Under its influence,
also, the finer particles of the soil are ever slowly
making their way from higher to lower levels. Rocks
which are being gradually disintegrated by weathering have
their finer grains and particles, thus loosened, carried away
by rain. Nor is this rain-action so inconsiderable as might
be supposed. In the gentler hollows of an undulating
country, we frequently find accumulations of clay, loam, and
brick-earth, which often reach many feet in thickness, and
which are undoubtedly the results of rain washing down the
particles of soil, &amp;c. from the adjacent slopes.</p>

<p>63. <i>River-action.</i>&mdash;The water of streams and rivers almost
invariably contains in solution one or more chemical compounds,
and in this respect does not differ from the water of
springs. Of course, this mineral matter is derived in considerable
measure from springs, but is also no doubt to a
large extent taken up by the rivers themselves, as they wash
the rocks and soils on their journey to the sea. The amount
of mineral matter thus transported must be something enormous,
as is shewn by the chemical analyses of river-water.
Bischof calculated that the Rhine carries in solution as
much carbonate of lime as would suffice for the yearly formation
of three hundred and thirty-two thousand millions
of oyster-shells of the usual size&mdash;a quantity equal to a cube
five hundred and sixty feet in the side, or a square bed
a foot thick, and upwards of two miles in the side. But
the mechanical erosion effected by running water is what
impresses us most with the importance of rivers as geological
agencies. This erosive action is due to the gravel, sand,
and mud carried along by the water. These ingredients
act as files in the hand of a workman, and grind, polish, and
reduce the rocks against which they are borne. The beds
of some streams that flow over solid rock are often pitted
with circular holes, at the bottom of which one invariably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
finds a few rounded stones. These stones, kept in constant
motion by the water, are the means by which the <i>pot-holes</i>,
as they are called, have been excavated. When pot-holes
are numerous, they often unite so as to form curious
smooth-sided trenches and gullies. The same filing action
goes on all over the bed of the stream wherever the solid rock
is exposed. And while the latter is being gradually reduced,
the stones and grit which act as the files are themselves
worn and reduced; so that stones diminish in size, and grit
passes into fine sand and mud, as they move from higher to
lower levels. No doubt the erosive action of running water
appears to have but small effect in a short time, and we are
apt, therefore, to underestimate its power. But when our
observations extend, we see it is quite otherwise, and that,
so far from being unimportant, running water is really one
of the most powerful of all the geological agencies that are
employed in modifying the earth's crust. Even within a
comparatively short time, it is able to effect very considerable
changes. Thus, the river Simeto, in Sicily, having
become dammed by a stream of lava flowing from Etna,
succeeded, in two hundred and fifty years, in cutting through
hard solid basalt a new channel for itself, which measured
from twenty to fifty mètres in depth, and from twelve to
eighteen in breadth. When, also, we remember the fact,
that no river is absolutely free from mineral matter held in
suspension, but that, on the contrary, all running water is
more or less discoloured with sediment, which is merely the
material derived from the disintegration of rocks, it will
appear to us difficult to overestimate the power of watery
erosion. To the mineral matter held in suspension, we have
to add the coarser detritus, gravel and sand, which is being
gradually pushed along the beds of rivers, and which, in the
case of the Mississippi, has been estimated to equal a mass
of seven hundred and fifty million cubic feet, discharged
annually into the Gulf of Mexico. By careful measurements,
it has also been ascertained that the same river carries down
annually into the sea a weight of mud held in suspension
which reaches the vast sum of 812,500,000,000 pounds.
The total annual amount of mineral matter, whether held in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
suspension or pushed along the bottom of this great river,
has been estimated to equal a mass 268 feet in height, with
an area of one square mile.</p>

<p>64. <i>Alluvium.</i>&mdash;The sediment carried along and deposited
by a river is called <i>alluvium</i>. Sometimes this alluvium
covers wide areas, forming broad flats on one or both sides of
a river, and in such cases it is due to the action of the floodwaters
of the stream. Every time the river overflows the low
grounds through which it passes, a layer of sediment is laid
down, which has the effect of gradually raising the level of
the alluvial tract. By and by a time comes when the river,
which has all the while been slowly deepening its channel,
is unable to flood the flats, and thereupon it begins to cut
into these, and to form new flats at a somewhat lower level.
In this way we often observe a series of alluvial terraces,
consisting of gravel, sand, and silt, rising one above another
along a river valley. Such are the terraces of the Thames
and other rivers in England, and of the Tweed, Clyde, Tay,
&amp;c. in Scotland. The great plains through which the
Rhine flows between Basel and Bingen, are also well-marked
examples of alluvial accumulations. There are
very few streams, indeed, which have not formed such
deposits along some portion of their course.</p>

<p>65. When a river enters a lake, the motion of the water is
of course checked, and hence the heavier detritus, such as
gravel and coarse sand, moves more slowly forward, and at
last comes to rest on the bed of the lake, at no great distance
from the mouth of the river. Finer sand and mud
are carried out for some distance further, but eventually
they also cease to move, and sink to the bottom. When
the lake is sufficiently large, it catches all or nearly all the
matter brought down by the river, which, as it issues from
the lower end of the lake, is bright and clear. A well-known
example of this phenomenon is that of the Rhone, which
enters the Lake of Geneva turbid and muddy, but rushes
out quite clear at the lower end of the lake. Lakes, therefore,
are all being slowly or more rapidly silted up, and this,
of course, is most conspicuous at the points where they
are entered by rivers. Thus, at the head of the Lake of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Geneva, it is manifest that the wide flat through which
the river flows before it pours into the lake, has been conquered
by the Rhone from the latter. In the times of the
Romans, the lake, as we know, extended for more than one
mile and a half further up the valley.</p>

<p>66. <i>Deltas.</i>&mdash;When there are no lakes to intercept fluviatile
sediment, this latter is borne down to the sea, where it is
deposited in precisely the same way as in a lake: the heavier
detritus comes to rest first, the finer sediment being swept
out for some distance further. So that, in passing from the
river-mouth outwards, we have at first gravel, which gradually
gets finer and finer until it is replaced by sand, while this in
turn is succeeded by mud and silt. There is this difference,
however, between lacustrine and fluvio-marine deposits, that
while the former accumulate in water which is comparatively
still, the latter are often brought under the influence of waves
and currents, and become shifted and sifted to such a degree
that fine and coarse detritus are frequently commingled; and
there is, therefore, not the same orderly succession of coarse
and fine materials which characterises lacustrine deposits.
Often, indeed, the currents opposite the mouth of a river
are so strong, that little or no sediment is permitted to
gather there. Usually, however, we find that rivers have
succeeded in reclaiming more or less wide tracts from the
dominion of the waves, or at all events have cumbered the
bed of the sea with banks and bars of detritus. The broad
plains formed at the mouth of a river are called <i>deltas</i>, from
their resemblance to the Greek letter &Delta;. The deltas of the
Nile, Ganges, and Mississippi are among the most noted.
The term <i>delta</i>, however, is not exclusively applied to fluvio-marine
deposits; rivers also form deltas in fresh-water
lakes. It is usual, however, to restrict the term to extensive
alluvial plains which are intersected by many winding
channels, due to the rapid bifurcation of the river, which
begins to take place at the very head of the great flat&mdash;that
is to say, at the point where the river originally entered the
sea (or lake).</p>

<p>67. <i>Frozen Water.</i>&mdash;We have now seen what can be done
by the mechanical action of running water. We have next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
to consider what modifications are effected by freezing and
frozen water. Water, as every one knows, expands in the
act of freezing, and in doing so exerts great force. Let the
reader bear in mind what has been said as to the passage
of water through the minute and often invisible pores of
rocks, and to its presence in cracks and crevices after every
shower of rain, and he will readily see how excessive must
be the waste caused by the action of frost. The water, to
as great a depth as the frost extends, passes into the solid
state, and in doing so pushes the grains of the rocks
asunder, or wedges out large masses. No sooner does
thaw ensue than the water, becoming melted, allows the
grains of the rock to fall asunder; the outer skin of the
rock, as it were, is disintegrated, and crumbles away, while
fragments and masses lose their balance in many cases, and
topple down. Hence it is, that in all regions where frost
acts, the hill-tops and slopes are covered with angular
fragments and débris, and a soil is readily formed by the
disintegration of the rocks.</p>

<p>River-ice is often a potent agent of geological change.
Stones get frozen in along the margins of a river, and
often débris falls down from cliff and scaur upon the surface
of the ice; when thaw sets in, and the ice breaks up,
stones and rubbish are frequently floated for long distances,
and may even be carried out to sea before their support
fails them, and they sink to the bottom. In some cases,
when the ice is very thick, it may run aground in a river,
and confuse and tumble up the deposits gathering at the
bottom. Ice sometimes forms upon stones at the bottom
of a river, and floats these off; and this curious action
may take place even although no ice be forming at the
time on the surface of the water.</p>

<p>68. <i>Glaciers, Icebergs, and Ice-foot.</i>&mdash;In certain mountainous
districts, and in arctic and antarctic regions, snow
accumulates to such an extent that its own weight suffices
to press the lower portions into ice. Alternate thawing and
freezing also aid in the formation of the ice, which soon
begins to creep down the mountain-slopes into the valleys,
where it constitutes what are called <i>glaciers</i> or ice-rivers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
These great masses of ice attain often a great thickness,
and frequently extend for many miles along the course of
a valley. In the Alps they occasionally reach as much as
five hundred or six hundred feet in depth. In Greenland,
however, there are glaciers probably not less than five
thousand feet thick; and the glacier ice of the antarctic
continent has been estimated even to reach twelve miles in
thickness. Glaciers flow slowly down their valleys, at a
rate which varies with the slope of their beds and the mass
of the ice. Some move only a few inches, others two or
three feet, in a day. Their forward motion is arrested at
a point where the ice is melted just as fast as it comes on.
A glacier is always more or less seamed with yawning cracks,
which are called <i>crevasses</i>. These owe their origin to the
unequal rate at which the different parts of the ice flow;
this differential motion causing strains, to which the ice
yields by snapping asunder. The flanks of a glacier are
usually fringed with heaps of angular blocks and débris
which fall from the adjacent rocky slopes, and some of
this rubbish tumbling into the gaping crevasses must
occasionally reach to the bottom of the ice. The rubbish
heaps (<i>superficial moraines</i>) travel slowly down the valley
on the surface of the ice, and are eventually toppled over
the end of the glacier, where they form great banks and
mounds. These are called <i>terminal moraines</i>. The rocky
bed of a glacier is invariably smoothed and polished, and
streaked with coarse and fine <i>striæ</i>, or scratches, which run
parallel to the direction of the ice-flow. These are due to
the presence, at the bottom of the ice, of such angular fragments
as become detached from the underlying rocks, or of
boulders and rubbish which have been introduced from
above. The stones are ground by the ice along the surface
of its bed, causing ruts and scratches, while the finer
material resulting from the grinding action forms a kind of
polisher. The stones acting as gravers are themselves
covered with striæ, and their sharp edges get smoothed
away. In alpine districts there is always a good deal of
water circulating underneath a glacier, and this washes out
the sand and fine clay. Thus it is that rivers issuing from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
glaciers are always more or less discoloured brown, yellow,
green, gray, or blue, according to the nature of the rocks
which the ice has pounded down into mud. In Greenland
many of the large glaciers go right out to sea, and owing to
their great thickness are able to dispossess the sea sometimes
for miles. But erelong the greater specific gravity of
the sea-water forces off large segments from the terminal
front of the ice, which float away as <i>icebergs</i>. Large masses
are also always falling down from the ice-front. Occasionally,
big blocks and débris are floated away on the icebergs,
but this does not appear to be common. In Greenland
there is very little rock-surface exposed, from which blocks
can be showered down upon the glaciers, and the surface
of the latter is therefore generally free from superficial
moraines. A kind of submarine terminal moraine, however,
gathers in front of some glaciers, made up chiefly of
the stones and rubbish that are dragged along underneath
the ice, and exposed by the breaking-off of icebergs, but
partly composed also of the sand and mud washed out by
sub-glacial waters. A narrow belt of ice forms along the
sea-coast in arctic regions, which often attains a thickness of
thirty or forty feet. This is called the <i>ice-foot</i>. It becomes
loaded with débris and blocks, which fall upon it from the
cliffs above; and, as large portions are frequently detached
from the cliffs in summer-time, they sail off with their
cargoes of débris, and drop these over the sea-bottom as
they gradually melt away. The ice-foot is the great distributor
of <i>erratics</i> or wandered blocks, the part taken in
this action by the huge icebergs which are discharged by
the glaciers being, comparatively speaking, insignificant.
But when these latter run aground, they must often cause
great confusion among the beds of fine material accumulating
upon the floor of the sea.</p>

<p>69. <i>The Sea.</i>&mdash;Sea-water owes its saltness to the presence
of various more or less soluble substances, such as <i>common
salt</i>, <i>gypsum</i>, <i>Epsom salts</i>, <i>chloride of magnesium</i>, &amp;c.
Besides these, there are other ingredients held in solution,
which, although they can be detected in only minute quantities
in sea-water, are yet of the very utmost importance to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
marine creatures. This is the case with <i>carbonate of lime</i>,
vast quantities of which are carried down by many rivers to
the sea. But it must be nearly all used up in the formation
of hard shells and skeletons by molluscs, crustaceans,
corals, &amp;c., for very little can be traced in the water itself.
<i>Silica</i> is also met with sparingly, and is abstracted by
some creatures to form their hard coverings.</p>

<p>70. <i>Breaker-action&mdash;Currents.</i>&mdash;The most conspicuous
action of the sea, as a geological agent, takes place along
its margin, where the breakers are hurled against the
land. Stones and gravel are borne with more or less
intense force against the rocks, and by their constant
battering succeed eventually in undermining the cliffs,
which by and by become top-heavy, and large masses
fall down and get broken up and pounded into gravel
and sand. The new wall of rock thus exposed becomes
in turn assaulted, and in course of time is undermined
in like manner. The waste of the cliffs is greatly aided
by the action of frost, which loosens the jointed rocks, and
renders them an easier prey to the force of the waves. Of
course, the rapidity with which a coast-line is eaten into
depends very much upon the nature of the rocks. Where
these are formed of loose materials like sand, gravel, or
clay, considerable inroads are effected by the sea in a comparatively
short time. Thus, along some parts of the
English coast, as between Flamborough Head and the
mouth of the Humber, and between the Wash and the
Thames, it is estimated that the land is wasted away at the
rate of a yard per annum. Where hard rocks form the
coast-line the rate of waste is often exceedingly slow, and
centuries may elapse without any apparent change being
effected. When the rocks are of unequal hardness the
coast-line becomes very irregular, the sea carving out
bays and gullies in the softer portions, while the more
durable masses stand out as capes and bold headlands.
Not unfrequently, such headlands are converted into sea-stacks
and rocky islets, as one may observe along the
rockier parts of our shore-lines. Close inshore, the bulkier
débris derived from the waste of the land often accumulates,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
forming beds and banks of shingle and gravel. The finer
materials are carried farther out to sea, and distributed
over the sea-floor by the action of the tide and currents.
Tidal and other currents may also have some denuding
effect upon the sea-bottom, but this can only be in comparatively
shallow water. The great bulk of the material
derived from the waste of the coasts by the mechanical
action of the breakers, travels for no great distance. But
the fine mud brought down by rivers is frequently transported
for vast distances before it settles. So fine, indeed,
is some of this sedimentary material, that it may be carried
in suspension by sea-currents for thousands of miles before
it sinks to the bottom.</p>

<p>71. From this short outline it becomes evident, therefore,
that the coarser-grained the deposit, the smaller will be the
area it covers; while conversely, the finer the accumulation,
the more widely will it be distributed. A partial exception
to this rule is that of the débris scattered over the bottom of
the ocean by icebergs and detached portions of ice-foot.
These are often floated for vast distances by currents
before they finally melt away, and hence the coarse débris
transported by them must be very widely distributed over
that part of the sea-bottom which is traversed by currents
flowing out of the Arctic and Antarctic Oceans. Although
the deeper recesses of the ocean appear to be covered only
with ooze and fine mud, yet in some instances coarse sand,
and even small stones, have been brought up from depths of
a hundred fathoms, so that currents may occasionally carry
coarser materials for great distances from the shore. The
shifting action of tidal currents succeeds in giving rise to
very irregular deposits in shallow seas. The soundings
often shew sudden changes from gravel to sand and mud,
nor can there be any doubt that, could we lay bare the sea-bottom,
we should often observe gravel shading off into
sand, and sand into mud, and <i>vice versâ</i>. But as we receded
from the shore, and approached areas which were once
deeply submerged, we should find that the change of
material was generally from coarse to fine.</p>

<a name="GEOLOGICAL_ACTION_OF_PLANTS_AND_ANIMALS"></a>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>
<div class="caption3">GEOLOGICAL ACTION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS.</div>

<p>72. <i>Plants.</i>&mdash;The disintegration of rocks is often aided by
the action of plants, which force their roots into joints and
crevices, and thus loosen blocks and fragments. Carbonic
acid, derived from the decay of plants, being absorbed by
rain-water, acts chemically upon many rocks, as in the
case of limestone (see <a href="#numb_59">59</a>, <a href="#numb_60">60</a>, <a href="#numb_61">61</a>). In temperate regions,
vegetation frequently accumulates, under certain conditions,
to form very considerable masses. Of such a
nature is <i>peat</i>, which, as is well known, covers many thousands
of acres in the British Islands. This substance is
composed fundamentally of the bog-moss (<i>Sphagnum palustre</i>),
with which, however, are usually associated many
other marsh-loving plants. The lower parts of bog-moss
die and decay while its upper portions continue to flourish,
and thus, in process of time, a thickness of peat is accumulated
to the extent of six, twelve, twenty-four, or even
forty feet. Many of the hill-tops and hill-slopes in Scotland
and Ireland are covered with a few feet of peat, but it is
only in valleys and hollows where the peat-bogs attain their
greatest depth. In not a few cases, the bogs seem to
occupy the sites of ancient lakes, shell-marl often occurring
at the bottom of these. The trunks and roots of trees
are also commonly met with underneath peat, and occasionally
the remains of land animals. Frequently, indeed,
it would seem as if the overthrow of the trees, by obstructing
the drainage of the country, had given rise to a marsh,
and the consequent formation of peat. Some of the most
valuable peat closely resembles lignite, and makes a good
fuel. In tropical countries, the rapidity with which vegetation
decays prevents, as a rule, any great accumulation
taking place; but the mangrove swamps are exceptions.</p>

<p>73. <i>Animals.</i>&mdash;The action of animal life is for the most
part conservative and reconstructive. Considerable accumulations
of shell-marl take place in fresh-water lakes, and
the flat bottoms which mark the sites of lakes which have
been drained are frequently dug to obtain this material.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
But by far the most conspicuous formations due to the
action of animal life accumulate in the sea. Molluscs,
crustaceans, corals, and the like, secrete from the ocean the
carbonate of lime of which their hard shells and skeletons
are composed, and these hard parts go to the formation of
limestone. The most remarkable masses of modern limestone
occur within intertropical regions. These are the
coral reefs of the Pacific and Indian Oceans.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>74. <i>Coral</i> is the calcareous skeleton of certain small soft-bodied
gelatinous animals called <i>actinozoa</i>. These zoophytes
flourish only in clear water, the temperature of
which is not below 66&deg;F., and they cannot live at greater
depths than one hundred feet. There are three kinds of
coral reef&mdash;namely, <i>fringing</i> reefs, <i>barrier</i> reefs, and <i>atolls</i>.
Fringing reefs occur, as a rule, near to the shore; but if
this latter be gently sloping, they may extend for one or
even two miles out to sea; as far, indeed, as the depth of
water is not too great for the actinozoa. Barrier reefs are
met with at greater distances from the land, and often rise
from profound depths. The barrier reef which extends
along the north-east coast of Australia, often at a distance
from the land of fifty or sixty miles, stretches, with interruptions,
for about 1250 miles, with a breadth varying from
ten to ninety miles. In some places, the depth of the sea
immediately outside of this reef exceeds 1800 feet. Sometimes
barrier reefs completely encircle an island or islands,
which are usually mountainous, as in the case of Pouynipète,
an island in the Caroline Archipelago, and the
Gambier Islands in the Low Archipelago. <i>Atolls</i> are more
or less irregular ring-shaped reefs inclosing a lagoon of
quiet water. They usually rise from profound depths;
Keeling Atoll, in the Indian Ocean, is a good example.
The upper surface of atolls and barrier reefs often peers at
separate points above the level of the sea, so as to form
low-lying islets. In some cases, the land thus formed is
almost co-extensive with the reef, and being clothed with
palms and tropical verdure, resembles a beautiful chaplet
floating, as it were, in mid-ocean. The rock of a coral reef is
a solid white limestone, similar in composition to that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
the limestones occurring in this country. In some places,
it is quite compact, shewing few or no inclosed shells
or other animal remains; in other places, it is made
up of broken and comminuted corals cemented together, or
of masses of coral standing as they slowly grew, with the
spaces between the separate clumps filled up with coral
sand and triturated fragments and grit of coral and shell.
The thickness of the reefs is often very great, reaching in
many cases to thousands of feet. At the Fijis, the reef
can hardly be less than 2000 or 3000 feet thick. Below a
depth of one hundred feet, all the coral rock is dead, and
since the coral zoophytes do not live at greater depths than
this, it follows that the bed of the sea in which coral reefs
occur must have slowly subsided during a long course of
ages. Mr Darwin was the first to give a reasonable explanation
of the origin of coral reefs. Briefly stated, his explanation
is as follows: The corals began to grow first in
water not exceeding one hundred feet in depth, and built up
to the surface of the sea, thus forming a fringing reef at no
great distance from the land. This initial step is shewn at
A, B, in the accompanying section across a coral island.
A, A, are the outer edges of the fringing reef; B, B, the
shores of the island; and S1 the level of the sea. Subsidence
ensuing, the island and the sea-bottom sink slowly
down, while the coral animals continue to grow to the
surface&mdash;the building of the reef keeping pace with the
subsidence. By and by the island sinks to the level S2,
when B´, B´, represent the shores of the now diminished
island, and A´, A´, the outer edges of the reef, which has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
become a barrier reef; C, C, being the lagoon between the
reef and the central island. We have now only to suppose
a continuance of the submergence to the level S3, when the
island disappears, its site being occupied by a lagoon, C´&mdash;the
reef, which has at the same time become an atoll, being shewn at A´´, A´´.</p>

<p>75. In extra-tropical latitudes, great accumulations of carbonate
of lime are also taking place. The bottom of the
Atlantic has been found to be covered, over vast areas, by
a fine calcareous sticky deposit called <i>ooze</i>, which would
appear to consist for the most part of the skeletons of
minute animal organisms, called Foraminifera. This
accumulation, when dried, closely resembled chalk, and
there can be no doubt that in the deep recesses of the
Atlantic we have thus a gradually increasing deposit of
carbonate of lime, which rivals, if it does not exceed, in
extent the most widely spread calcareous rocks with which
we are acquainted. A small percentage of siliceous materials
occurs in the ooze, made up partly of granules of quartz,
and partly of the skeletons and coverings of minute animal
and vegetable organisms. When in process of time the
chemical forces begin to act upon the siliceous matter
diffused through the Atlantic ooze, <i>segregation</i>, or the
gathering together of the particles, may take place, and
nodules of flint will be the result, similar to the flint nodules
which occur in chalk, and the cherty concretions in limestones.
Animalcules with siliceous envelopes and skeletons
are by no means so abundant as those that secrete carbonate
of lime, but they are very widely diffused through
the oceans, and in favourable places are so abundant that
they may well give rise eventually to extensive beds of flint.
Ehrenberg calculated that 17,946 cubic feet of these
organisms were formed annually in the muddy bottom of
the harbour at Wismar, in the Baltic.</p>

<p>It would appear from recent observations (<i>Challenger</i>
expedition) that the calcareous ooze at the bottom of the
Atlantic and Southern Oceans, which occurs at a mean depth
of 2250 fathoms, passes gradually as the ocean deepens into
a gray ooze, which is less calcareous, and which occurs at a
mean depth of 2400 fathoms. At still greater depths this
gray ooze also disappears, and is replaced by red clay at a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
mean depth of 2700 fathoms. The minute creatures (foraminifera
and pelagic mollusca chiefly) whose shells go to
form the calcareous ooze, live for the most part on the surface,
and swarm all over the areas in which ooze and red
clay occur at the bottom. Hence it seems probable that
the clay is merely the insoluble residue or <i>ash</i>, as it were, of
the organisms&mdash;the delicate shells, as they slowly sink to the
more profound depths, being dissolved by the free carbonic
acid, which, as observations would seem to shew, occurs
rather in excess at great depths. Thus we see how the
organic forces may give rise to extensive accumulations of
inorganic matter, closely resembling the finest silt or mud
which is carried down to the sea by rivers, and distributed
far and wide by ocean currents.</p>

<div class="caption3">SUBTERRANEAN FORCES.</div>

<p>76. There have been many speculations as to the condition
of the interior of the earth. Some have inferred that
the external crust of the globe incloses a fluid or molten
mass; others think it more probable that the interior is
solid, but contains scattered throughout its bulk, especially
towards the surface of the earth, irregular seas of molten
matter, occupying large vesicles or tunnels in the solid
honey-combed mass. At present, the facts known would
appear to be best explained by the latter hypothesis. All
that we know from observation is, that the temperature
increases as we descend from the surface. The rate of
increase is very variable. Thus, in the Artesian well at
Neuffen, in Würtemberg, it was as much as 1&deg;F. for every
19 feet. In the mines of Central Germany, however, the
increase is only 1&deg;F. for every 76 feet; while in the
Dukinfield coal-pit, near Manchester, the increase was still
less, being only 1&deg;F. in 89 feet. Taking the average of
many observations, it may be held as pretty well proved
that the temperature of the earth's crust increases 1&deg; for
every 50 or 60 feet of descent after the first hundred.</p>

<p>77. The crust of the earth is subject to certain movements,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
which are either sudden and paroxysmal, or protracted and
tranquil. The former are known as earthquakes, which
may or may not result in a permanent alteration of the
relative level of land and sea; the latter always effect
some permanent change, either of upheaval or depression.</p>

<p>78. <i>Earthquakes</i> have been variously accounted for.
Those who uphold the hypothesis of a fluid interior think
the undulatory motion experienced at the surface is caused
by movements in the underlying molten mass&mdash;an earthquake
being thus 'the reaction of the liquid nucleus against
the outer crust.' By others, again, earthquakes are supposed
to be caused by the fall of large rock-masses from
the roofs of subterranean cavities, or by any sudden impulse
or blow, such as might be produced by the cracking of
rocks in a state of tension, by a sudden volcanic outburst,
or sudden generation or condensation of steam. In support
of this latter hypothesis, many facts may be adduced. The
undulatory motion communicated to the ground during gunpowder
explosions, or by the fall of rocks from a mountain,
is often propagated to great distances from the scene of
these catastrophes, and the phenomena closely resemble
those which accompany a true earthquake. When the level
of a district has been permanently affected by an earthquake,
the movement has generally resulted in a lowering
of the surface. Thus, in 1819, the Great Runn of Cutch, in
Hindustan, was depressed over an area of several thousand
square miles, so as during the monsoons to become a salt
lagoon. Occasionally, however, we find that elevation of
the land has taken place during an earthquake. This was
the case in New Zealand in 1855, when the ground on
which the town of Wellington stands rose about two feet,
and a cape in the neighbourhood nearly ten feet. Sometimes
the ground so elevated is, after a shorter or longer
period, again depressed to its former level. A good example
of this occurred in South America in 1835. The shore at
Concepcion was raised a yard and a half; and the Isle
Santa Maria was pushed up two and a half yards at one
end, and three and a half yards at the other. But only
a few months afterwards the ground sank again, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
everything returned to its old position. The heaving and
undulatory motion of an earthquake produces frequently
considerable changes at the surface of the ground, besides
an alteration of level. Rocks are loosened, and sometimes
hurled down from cliff and mountain-side, and streams are
occasionally dammed with the soil and rubbish pitched
into them. Sometimes also the ground opens, and swallows
whatever chances to come in the way. If these chasms
close again permanently, no change in the physiography of
the land may take place, but sometimes they remain open,
and affect the drainage of the country.</p>

<p>79. <i>Movements of Upheaval and Depression.</i>&mdash;Besides the
permanent alteration of level which is sometimes the result
of a great earthquake, it is now well known that the crust
of the earth is subject to long-continued and tranquil
movements of elevation and depression. The cause of these
movements is at present merely matter for speculation, some
being of opinion that they may be caused by the gradual
contraction of the slowly cooling nucleus of the earth, which
would necessarily give rise to depression, while this movement,
again, would be accompanied by some degree of
elevation&mdash;the result of the lateral push or thrust effected
by the descending rock-masses. It is doubtful, however,
if this hypothesis will explain all the appearances. The
Scandinavian peninsula affords a fine example of the
movements in question. At the extremity of the peninsula
(Scania), the land is slowly sinking, while to the north of
that district gradual elevation is taking place at a very
variable rate, which in some places reaches as much as two
or three feet in a century. Movements of elevation are
also affecting Spitzbergen, Northern Siberia, North Greenland,
the whole western borders of South America, Japan,
the Kurile Islands, Asia Minor, and many other districts in
the Mediterranean area, besides various islets in the great
Pacific Ocean. The proofs of a slow movement of elevation
are found in old <i>sea-beaches</i> and <i>sea-caves</i>, which now stand
above the level of the sea. In the case of Scandinavia, it
has been noticed that the pine-woods which clothe the
mountains are being slowly elevated to ungenial heights, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
are therefore gradually dying out along their upper limits.
The proofs of depression of the land are seen in submerged
forests and peat, which occur frequently around our own
shores, and there is also strong human testimony to such
downward movements of the surface. The case of Scania
has already been referred to. Several streets in some
of its coast towns have sunk below the sea, and it is calculated
that the Scanian coast has lost to the extent of
thirty-two yards in breadth within the past hundred and
thirty years. The coral reefs of southern oceans also afford
striking evidence of a great movement of depression.</p>

<p>Not long ago a theory was started by a French savant, M.
Adhémar, to account for changes in the sea-level, without
having recourse to subterranean agency. He pointed out
that a vast ice-cap, covering the northern regions of our
hemisphere, as was certainly the case during what is
termed the glacial epoch, would cause a rise of the sea
by displacing the earth's centre of gravity. Mr James
Croll has recently strongly supported this opinion; and
there can be no doubt that we have here a <i>vera causa</i>
of considerable mutations of level. It is unquestionably
true, however, that great oscillatory movements, such as
described above, and which can only be attributed to
subterranean agencies, have frequently taken and are still
taking place.</p>

<p>80. Such movements of the earth's crust cannot take
place without effecting some change upon the strata of
which that crust is composed. During <i>depression</i> of the
curved surface of the earth, the under strata must necessarily
be subjected to intense lateral pressure, since they are
compelled to occupy less space, and contortion and plication
will be the result. It is evident also that contortion will
diminish from below upwards, so that we can conceive that
excessive contortion may be even now taking place at a
great depth from the surface in Greenland. During a movement
of <i>elevation</i>, on the other hand, the strata are subjected
to excessive tension, and must be seamed with great rents:
when the elevating force is removed, the disrupted rocks
will settle down unequally&mdash;in other words, they will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
<i>faulted</i>, and their continuity will be broken. But both contortion
and faulting may be due, on a small scale, to local
causes, such as the intrusion of igneous rocks, the consolidation
of strata, the falling in of old water-courses, &amp;c.
<i>Cleavage</i> is believed to have been caused by compression,
such as the rocks might well be subjected to during great
movements of the earth's crust. The particles of which the
rock is composed are compressed in one direction, and of
course are at the same time drawn out at right angles to the
pressure. This is observed not only as regards the particles
of the rock themselves, but imbedded fossils also are distorted
and flattened in precisely the same way.</p>

<p>81. <i>Volcanoes.</i>&mdash;Besides movements of elevation and
depression, there are certain other phenomena due to the
action of the subterranean forces. Such are the ejection
from the interior of the earth of heated matters, and their
accumulation upon the surface. The erupted materials consist
of molten matter (lava), stones and dust, gases and
steam&mdash;the lava, ashes, and stones gradually accumulating
round the focus of ejection, and thus tending to form a
conical hill or mountain. Could we obtain a complete
section of such a volcanic cone, we should find it built up of
successive irregular beds of lava, and layers of stones and
ashes, dipping outwards and away from the source of eruption,
but having round the walls of the <i>crater</i> (that is, the
cavity at the summit of the truncated cone) a more or less
perceptible dip inwards. <a href="#fig_25">Fig. 25</a> gives a condensed view
of the general phenomena accompanying an eruption. In
this ideal section, <i>a</i> is the funnel or neck of the volcano
filled with lava; <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, the crater. The molten lava is highly
charged with elastic fluids, which continually escape from
its surface with violent explosions, and rise in globular
clouds, <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>, to a certain height, after which they dilate
into a dark cloud, <i>c</i>. From this cloud showers of rain, <i>e</i>,
are frequently discharged. Large and small portions of the
incandescent lava are shot upwards as the imprisoned
vapour of water explodes and makes its escape, and, along
with these, fragments of the rocks forming the walls of the
crater and the funnel are also violently discharged; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
cooled bombs, angular stones, and <i>lapilli</i>, as the smaller
stones are called, falling in showers, <i>f</i>, upon the exterior parts
of the cone or into the crater, from which they are again
and again ejected. Most frequently the great weight of the
lava inside the crater suffices to break down the side of the
cone, and the molten rock escapes through the breach.
Sometimes, however, it issues from beneath the base of the
cone. At other times, finding for itself some weak place in the
cone, it may flow out by a lateral fissure, <i>g</i>. In the diagram,
<i>i</i>, <i>i</i> represents the lava streaming down the outward slopes,
jets of steam and fumaroles escaping from almost every part
of its surface. Forked lightning often accompanies an
eruption, and is supposed to be generated by the intense
mutual friction in the air of the ejected stones. The
trituration to which these are subjected reduces them, first,
to a kind of coarse gravel (<i>lapillo</i>); then to sand (<i>puzzolana</i>);
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
and lastly, to fine dust or ashes (<i>ceneri</i>).</p>

<p>82. <i>Lava.</i>&mdash;Any rock which has been erupted from a
volcano in a molten state is called <i>lava</i>. Some modern
lava-streams cover a great extent of surface. One of two
streams which issued from the volcano of Skaptur Jokul
(Iceland) in 1783 overflowed an area fifty miles in length,
with a breadth in places of fifteen; the other was not much
less extensive, being forty miles in length, with an occasional
breadth of seven. In some places the lava exceeded 500
feet in thickness. Again, in 1855, an eruption in the island
of Hawaii sent forth a stream of lava sixty-five miles long,
and from one to ten miles wide. The surface of a stream
quickly cools and consolidates, and in doing so shrinks, so
as to become seamed with cracks, through which the incandescent
matter underneath can be seen. As the current
flows on, the upper crust separates into rough ragged
scoriform blocks, which are rolled over each other and
jammed into confused masses. The slags that cake upon
the face or front of the stream roll down before it, and thus
a kind of rude pavement is formed, upon which the lava
advances and is eventually consolidated. Thus, in most
cases, a bed of lava is scoriaceous as well below as above.
Other kinds of lava are much more ductile and viscous, and
coagulate superficially in glossy or wrinkled crusts. When
lava has inclosed fragments of aqueous rocks, such as
limestone, clay, or sandstone, these are observed to have
undergone some alteration. The sandstone is often much
hardened, the clay is porcelainised, and the limestone, still
retaining its carbonic acid, assumes a crystalline texture.
But the aqueous rock upon which lava has cooled does
not usually exhibit much change, nor does the alteration, as
a rule, extend more than a few feet (often only a few inches)
into the rock. A lava-current which entered a lake or
the sea, however, has sometimes caught up much of the
sediment gathering there, and become so commingled with
it, that in some parts it is hard to say whether the resulting
rock is more igneous or aqueous. Lava which has been
squirted up from below into cracks and crevices, and there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
consolidated so as to form <i>dykes</i>, sometimes, but not often,
produces considerable alteration upon the rocks which it
intersects. The basaltic structure is believed to be due to
the contraction of lava consequent upon its cooling. The
axes of the prisms are always perpendicular to the cooling
surface or surfaces, and in some cases the columns are
wonderfully regular. There are numerous varieties of lava,
such as <i>basalt</i>, <i>obsidian</i>, <i>pitchstone</i>, <i>pearlstone</i>, <i>trachyte</i>, &amp;c.;
some are heavy compact rocks, others are light and porous.
Many are finely or coarsely crystalline; others have a
glassy and resinous or waxy texture. Some shew a flaky or
laminated structure; others are concretionary. Most of the
lava rocks, however, are granularly crystalline. In many, a
vesicular character is observed. These vesicles, being due
to the bubbles of vapour that gathered in the molten rock,
usually occur in greatest abundance towards the upper
surface of a bed of lava. They are also more or less well
developed near the bottom of a bed, which, as already
explained, is frequently scoriaceous. Occasionally the
vesicles are disseminated throughout the entire rock. As a
rule, those lavas which are of inferior specific gravity are
much more vesicular than the denser and heavier varieties.
The vesicles are usually more or less flattened, having been
drawn out in the direction in which the lava-current flowed.
Sometimes they are filled, or partially filled, with mineral
matter introduced at the time of eruption, or subsequently
brought in a state of solution and deposited there by
water filtering through the rock: this forms what is
called <i>amygdaloidal lava</i>. In volcanic districts, the rocks
are often traversed by more or less vertical dykes or veins
of igneous matter. These dykes appear in some cases to
have been formed by the filling up of crevices from above&mdash;the
liquid lava having filtered downwards from an overflowing
mass. In most cases, however, the lava has been
injected from below, and not unfrequently the 'dykes'
seem to have been the feeders from which lava-streams
have been supplied&mdash;the feeders having now become exposed
to the light of day either by some violent eruption
which has torn the rocks asunder, or else by the gradual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
wearing away of the latter by atmospheric and aqueous
agencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="METAMORPHISM"></a>
<div class="caption3">METAMORPHISM.</div>

<p>83. Mention has already been made of the fact, that the
heated matters ejected from volcanoes, or forcibly intruded
into cracks, crevices, &amp;c., occasionally <i>alter</i> the rocks with
which they come in contact. When this alteration has
proceeded so far as to induce a crystalline or semi-crystalline
character, the rock so altered is said to be metamorphosed.
Metamorphism has likewise been produced by the chemical
action of percolating water, which frequently dissolves out
certain minerals, and replaces these with others having often
a very different chemical composition. But metamorphism
on the large scale&mdash;that is to say, metamorphism which has
affected wide areas, such as the northern Highlands of
Scotland and wide regions in Scandinavia, or the still vaster
areas in North America&mdash;has most probably been effected
both by the agency of heat and chemical action, at considerable
depths, and under great pressure. When we observe
what effect can be produced by heat upon rocks, under little
or no pressure, and how water percolating from above gradually
changes the composition of some rock-masses, we may
readily believe that at great depths, where the heat is excessive,
such metamorphic action must often be intensified.
Thus, for example, limestone heated in the usual way gives
off its carbonic acid gas, and is reduced to quicklime; but,
under sufficient pressure, this gas is not evolved, the limestone
becoming converted into a crystalline marble. Some
crystalline limestones, indeed, have all the appearance of
having at one time been actually melted and squirted under
great pressure into seams and cracks of the surrounding
strata. Heated water would appear to have been the agent
to which much of the metamorphism which affects the rocky
strata must be attributed. But the mode or modes in
which it has acted are still somewhat obscure; as may
be readily understood when it is remembered how difficult,
and often how impossible it is to realise or reproduce in
our laboratories the conditions under which deep-seated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
metamorphic action must frequently have taken place. In
foliated rocks, the minerals are chiefly quartz, felspar, and
mica, talc, or chlorite. The ingredients of these minerals
undoubtedly existed in a diffused state in the original rocks,
and heated water charged with alkaline carbonates, as it
percolated through the strata, either along the layers of
bedding or lines of cleavage, slowly acted upon these, dissolving
and redepositing them, and thus inducing segregation.
There is every kind of gradation in metamorphism.
Thus, we find certain rocks which are but slightly altered&mdash;their
original character being still quite apparent; while,
in other cases, the original character is so entirely effaced
that we can only conjecture what that may have been.
When we have a considerable thickness of metamorphic
rocks which still exhibit more or less distinct traces of
bedding, like the successive beds of gneiss, mica-schist,
and quartz rock of the Scottish Highlands, we can hardly
doubt that the now crystalline masses are merely highly
altered aqueous strata. But there are cases where even the
bedding becomes obliterated, and it is then much more
difficult to determine the origin of the rocks. Thus, we find
bedded gneiss passes often, by insensible gradations, into
true amorphous granite. There has been much difference
of opinion as to the origin of granite&mdash;some holding it to be
an igneous rock, others maintaining its metamorphic origin.
It is probably both igneous and metamorphic, however.
If we conceive of certain aqueous rocks becoming metamorphosed
into gneiss, we may surely conceive of the
metamorphism being still further continued until the mass
is reduced to a semi-fluid or pasty condition, when all trace
of foliation and bedding might readily disappear, and the
weight of the superincumbent strata would be sufficient to
force portions of the softened mass into cracks and crevices
of the still solid rocks above and around it. Hence we might
expect to find the same mass of granite passing gradually in
some places into gneiss, and in other places protruding as
<i>veins</i> and <i>dykes</i> into the surrounding rocks; and this is
precisely what occurs in nature.</p>

<p>84. <i>Mineral veins</i> have, as a rule, been formed by water
depositing along the walls of fissures the various matters
which they held in solution, but certain kinds of veins
(such as quartz veins in granite) probably owe their origin
to chemical action which has induced the quartz to segregate
from the rock mass. Some have maintained that the
metallic substances met with in many veins owe their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
deposition to the action of currents of voltaic electricity;
while others have attributed their presence to sublimation
from below, the metals having been deposited in the fissures
very much as lead is deposited in the chimney of a leadmill.
But in many cases there seems little reason to doubt
that the ores have merely been extracted from the rocks,
and re-deposited in fissures, by water, in the same way as
the other minerals with which they are associated.</p>

<p>85. <i>Denudation.</i>&mdash;By the combined action of all the geological
agencies which have been described in the preceding
sections, the earth has acquired its present diversified surface.
Valleys, lacustrine hollows, table-lands, and mountains have
all been more or less slowly formed by the forces which we
see even now at work in the world around us. When we
reflect upon the fact that all the inclined strata which crop
out at the surface of the ground are but the truncated
portions of beds that were once continuous, and formed
complete anticlinal arches or curves, we must be impressed
with the degree of <i>denudation</i>, or wearing-away, which the
solid strata have experienced. If we protract in imagination
the outcrop of a given set of strata, we shall find them
curving upwards into the air to a height of, it may be,
hundreds or even thousands of feet, before they roll over
to come down and fit on to the truncated ends of the beds
on the further side of the anticline (see <a href="#fig_9">figs. 9</a> <a href="#fig_11">and 11</a>, pages
33, 34). <i>Dislocations</i> or <i>faults</i> afford further striking evidence
in the same direction. Sometimes these have displaced
the strata for hundreds and even thousands of feet&mdash;that
is to say, that a bed occurring at, for example, a few
feet from the surface upon one side of a fault, has sunk
hundreds or thousands of feet on the other side. Yet it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
often happens that there is no irregularity at the surface to
betray the existence of a dislocation. The ground may be
flat as a bowling-green, and yet, owing to some great fault,
the rocks underneath one end of the flat may be geologically
many hundred feet, or even yards, higher or lower than the
strata underneath the other end of the same level space.
What has become of the missing strata? They have been
carried away grain by grain by the denuding forces&mdash;by
weathering, rain, frost, and fluviatile and marine action. The
whole surface of a country is exposed to the abrading action
of the subaërial forces, and has been carved by them into
hills and valleys, the position of which depends partly upon
the geological structure of the country, and partly upon the
texture and composition of the rocks. The original slope
of the surface, when it was first elevated out of the sea,
would be determined by the action of the subterraneous
forces&mdash;the dominant parts, whether table-lands or undulating
ridges, forming the centres from which the waters
would begin to flow. After the land had been subjected
for many long ages to the wearing action of the denuding
agents, it is evident that the softer rocks&mdash;those which were
least capable of withstanding weathering and erosion&mdash;would
be more worn away than the less easily decomposed
masses. The latter would, therefore, tend to form
elevations, and the former hollows. This is precisely what
we find in nature. The great majority of isolated hills
and hilly tracts owe their existence as such merely to the
fact that they are formed of more durable materials than
the rock-masses by which they are surrounded. When a
line of dislocation is visible at the surface, it is simply
because rocks of unequal durability have been brought into
juxtaposition. The more easily denuded strata have
wasted away to a greater extent than the tougher masses
on the other side of the dislocation. Nearly all elevations,
therefore, may be looked upon as monuments of the denudation
of the land; they form hills for the simple reason that
they have been better able to withstand the attacks of the
denuding agents than the rocks out of which the hollows
have been eroded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>
<p>86. To this general rule there are exceptions, the most
obvious being hills and mountains of volcanic origin, such
as Hecla, Etna, Vesuvius, &amp;c., and, on a larger scale, the
rocky ridge of the Andes. Again, it is evident that the
great mountain-chains of the world are due in the first
place to upheaval; but these mountains, as we now see them&mdash;peaks,
cliffs, precipices, gorges, ravines&mdash;have been carved
out of the solid block, as it were, by the ceaseless action of
the subaërial forces. The direction of river-valleys has
in like manner been determined in the first place by the
original slope of the land; but the deep dells, the broad
valleys and straths, have all been scooped out by running
water. The northern Highlands of Scotland, for
example, evidently formed at one time a broad table-land,
elevated above the level of the sea by the subterranean
forces. Out of this old table-land the denuding agents,
acting through untold ages, have carved out all the numerous
ravines, glens, and valleys, the intervening ridges left
behind now forming the mountains. It is true that now
and again streams are found flowing in the direction of a
fault, but that is simply because the dislocation is a line of
weakness, along which it is easier for the denuding forces
to act. For one fault that we find running parallel to the
course of a river, we may observe hundreds cutting across
its course at all angles. The great rocky basins occupied
by lakes, which are so abundant in the mountainous districts
of temperate regions and in northern latitudes, are believed
to have been excavated by the erosive power of glacier-ice;
and they point, therefore, to a time when our hemisphere
must have been subjected to a climate severe enough to
nourish massive glaciers in the British Islands and similar
latitudes. It may be concluded that the present physiography
of the land is proximately due solely to the action
of the denuding agents&mdash;rain, frost, rivers, and the sea.
But the lines along which these agents act with greatest
intensity have been determined in the first place by the
subterranean forces which upheaved the solid crust into
great table-lands or mountain undulations. Both the
remote and the proximate causes of the earth's surface-features,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
however, have acted in concert and contemporaneously,
for no sooner would new land emerge above the sea-level
than the breakers would assail it, and all the forces of
the atmosphere would be brought to bear upon it&mdash;rain,
frost, and rivers&mdash;so that the beginning of the sculpturing of
hill and valley dates back to the period when the present
lands were slowly emerging from the ocean. So great is
the denudation of the land, that in process of time the whole
would be planed down to the level of the sea, if it were not
for the subterranean forces, which from time to time depress
and elevate different portions of the earth's crust. It can
be proved that strata miles in thickness have been removed
bodily from the surface of our own country by the seemingly
feeble agents of denudation. All the denuded material&mdash;mud,
sand, and gravel&mdash;carried down into the sea has been
re-arranged into new beds, and these have ever and anon
been pushed up to the light of day, and scarped and channelled
by the denuding forces, the resulting detritus being
swept down as before into the sea, to form fresh deposits,
and so on. It follows, therefore, that the present arrangement
of land and sea has not always existed. There was
a time before the present distribution of land obtained, and
a time will yet arrive when, after infinite modifications
of surface and level, the continents and islands may be
entirely re-arranged, the sea replacing the land, and <i>vice
versâ</i>. To trace the history of such changes in the past is
one of the great aims of the scientific geologist.</p>

<p>87. <i>Fossils.</i>&mdash;In our description of rock-masses, and again
in our account of geological agencies, we referred to the fact
that certain rocks are composed in large measure, or exclusively,
of animal or vegetable organisms, or of both together;
and we saw that analogous organic formations were being
accumulated at the present time. But we have deferred to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
this place any special account of the organic remains which
are entombed in rocks. <i>Fossils</i>, as these are called, consist
generally of the harder and more durable parts of
animals and plants, such as bones, shells, teeth, seeds, bark,
and ligneous tissues, &amp;c. But it is usual to extend the
term fossil to even the <i>casts</i> or <i>impressions</i> of such remains,
and to foot-marks and tracks, whether of vertebrates,
molluscs, crustaceans, or annelids. The organic remains
met with in the rocks have usually undergone some chemical
change. They have become <i>petrified</i> wholly or in part.
The gelatine which originally gave flexibility to some of them
has disappeared, and even the carbonate and phosphate of
lime of the harder parts have frequently been replaced by
other mineral matter, by flint, pyrites, or the like. So perfect
is the petrifaction in many cases, that the most minute
structures have been entirely preserved&mdash;the original matter
having been replaced atom by atom. As a rule, fossils
occur most abundantly and in the best state in clay-rocks,
like shale; while in porous rocks, like sandstone, they are
generally poorly preserved, and not of so frequent occurrence.
One reason for this is, that clay-rocks are much
less pervious than sandstone, and their imbedded fossils
have consequently escaped in greater measure the solvent
powers of percolating water. But there are other reasons
for the comparative paucity of fossils in arenaceous strata,
as we shall see presently.</p>

<p>88. <i>Proofs of varied Physical Conditions.</i>&mdash;Organic remains
are either of terrestrial, fresh-water, or marine
origin, and they are therefore of the utmost value to the
geologist in deciphering the history of those great changes
which have culminated in the present. But we can go
a step further than this. We know that at the present
day the distribution of animal and vegetable life is due
to a variety of causes&mdash;to climatic and physical conditions.
The creatures inhabiting arctic and temperate
regions contrast strongly with those that tenant the tropics.
So also we observe a change in animal and vegetable forms
as we ascend from the low grounds of a country to its
mountain heights. Similar changes take place in the sea.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
The animals and plants of littoral regions differ from those
whose habitat is in deeper water. Now, the fossiliferous
strata of our globe afford similar proofs of varying climatic
and physical conditions. There are littoral deposits and
deep-sea accumulations: the former are generally coarse-grained
(conglomerates, grit, and sandstone); the latter are
for the most part finer-grained (clay, shale, limestone, chalk,
&amp;c.); and both inshore and deep-water formations have
each their peculiar organic remains. Again, we know that
some parts of the sea-bottom are not so prolific in life as
others&mdash;where, for example, any considerable deposit of
sand is taking place, or where sediment is being constantly
washed to and fro upon the bottom, shells and other
creatures do not appear in such numbers as where there
is less commotion, and a finer and more equable deposit
is taking place. It is partly for the same reason that
certain rocks are more barren of organic remains than
others.</p>

<p>89. <i>Fossil Genera and Species frequently extinct.</i>&mdash;It
might perhaps at first be supposed that similar rocks
would contain similar fossils. For example, we might
expect that formations resembling in their origin those
which are now forming in our coral seas would also, like
the latter, contain corals in abundance, with some commingling
of shells, crustaceans, fish, &amp;c., such as are
peculiar to the warm seas in which corals flourish. And
this in some measure holds good. But when we examined
carefully the fossils in certain of the limestones of
our own country, we should find that while the same great
orders and classes were actually present, yet the genera and
species were frequently entirely different; and not only so,
but that often none of these were now living on the earth.
Moreover, if we extended our research, we should soon
discover that similar wide differences actually obtained
between many of the limestones themselves and other
fossiliferous strata of our country.</p>

<p>90. <i>Fossiliferous Strata of Different Ages.</i>&mdash;Another fact
would also gradually dawn upon us&mdash;this, namely, that
in certain rocks the fossils depart much more widely from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
analogous living forms, than the organic remains in certain
other rocks do. The cause of this lies in the fact
that the fossiliferous strata are of different ages; they
have not all been formed at approximately the same time.
On the contrary, they have been slowly amassed, as we
have seen, during a long succession of eras. While they
have been accumulating, great vicissitudes in the distribution
of land and sea have taken place, climates have frequently
altered, and the whole organic life of the globe has
slowly changed again and again&mdash;successive races of plants
and animals flourishing each for its allotted period, and
then becoming extinct for ever.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> Thus, strata formed at
approximately the same time contain generally the same
fossils; while, on the other hand, sedimentary deposits
accumulated at different periods are charged with different
fossils. Fossils in this way become invaluable to the geologist.
They enable him to identify formations in separate
districts, and to assign to them their relative antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> If,
for example, we have a series of formations, A, B, C, piled
one on the top of the other, A being the lowest, and C the
highest, and each charged with its own peculiar fossils, we
may compare the fossils met with in other sets of strata
with the organic remains found in A, B, C. Should the
former be found to correspond with the fossil contents of
B, we conclude that the rocks in which they occur are
approximately of contemporaneous origin with B, even
although the equivalents of the formations A and C should
be entirely wanting. Further, we soon learn that the order
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of the series A, B, C, is never inverted. If A be the lowest,
and C the highest stratum in one place, it is quite certain
that the same order of succession will obtain wherever the
equivalents of these strata happen to occur together. But
the succession of strata is not invariably the same all the
world over; in some countries, we may have dozens of separate
formations piled one on the top of the other; in other
countries, many members of the series are absent; in brief,
<i>blanks in the succession</i> are of constant occurrence. But by
dovetailing, as it were, all the formations known to us, we
are enabled to form a more or less complete series of rocks
arranged in the order of their age. A little reflection will
serve to shew that the partial mode in which the strata are
distributed over the globe arises chiefly from two causes.
We have to remember, <i>first</i>, that the deposits themselves
were laid down only here and there in irregular spreads and
patches&mdash;opposite the mouths of rivers, at various points
along the ancient coast-lines, and over certain areas in the
deeper abysses of the ocean&mdash;the coarser accumulations
being of much less extent than those formed of finer materials.
And, <i>second</i>, we must not forget the intense denudation
which they have experienced, so that miles and miles
of strata which once existed have been swept away, and
their materials built up into new formations.</p>

<p>91. <i>Gradual Extinction of Species.</i>&mdash;When a sufficient
number of fossils has been diligently compared, we discover
that those in the younger strata approach most nearly to
the present living forms, and that the older the strata are,
the more widely do their organic remains depart from existing
types of animals and plants. We may notice also, that
when a series of beds graduate up into each other, so that
no strongly marked line separates the overlying from the
underlying strata, there is also a similar gradation amongst
the fossils. The fossils in the highest beds may differ
entirely from those in the lowest; but in the middle beds
there is an intermingling of forms. In short, it is evident
that the creatures gradually became extinct, and were just as
gradually replaced by new forms, until a time came when
all the species that were living while the lowest beds were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
being amassed, at last died out, and a complete change
was effected.</p>

<p>92. <i>Proofs of Cosmical Changes of Climate.</i>&mdash;From the
preceding remarks it will be also apparent that fossils
teach us much regarding the climatology of past ages.
They tell us how the area of the British Islands has
experienced many vicissitudes of climate, sometimes rejoicing
in a warm or almost tropical temperature, at other
times visited with a climate as severe as is now experienced
in arctic and antarctic regions. Not only so, but we learn
from fossils that Greenland once supported myrtles and
other plants which are now only found growing under mild
and genial climatic conditions; while, on the other hand,
remains of arctic mammals are met with in the south of
France. Such great changes of climate are due, according
to Mr Croll, to variations in the eccentricity of the earth's
orbit combined with the precession of the equinox. It is
well known that the orbit of our earth becomes much more
elliptical at certain irregularly recurring periods than it is at
present. During a period of extreme ellipticity, the earth is,
of course, much further away from the sun in <i>aphelion</i><a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a>
than it is at a time of moderate ellipticity, while, in <i>perihelion</i>,<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a>
it is considerably nearer. Now, let us suppose that,
at a time when the ellipticity is great, the movement known
as the precession of the equinox has changed the incidence
of our seasons, so that our summer happens in perihelion
and not in aphelion, while that of the southern hemisphere
occurs in aphelion, and not, as at present, in perihelion.
Under such conditions, the climate of the globe would
experience a complete change. In the northern hemisphere,
so long and intensely cold would the winter be, that
all the moisture that fell would fall as rain, and although
the summer would be very warm, it would nevertheless be
very short, and the heat then received would be insufficient
to melt the snow and ice which had accumulated during the
winter. Thus gradually snow and ice would cover all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
lands down to temperate latitudes. In the southern hemisphere,
the reverse of all this would obtain. The winter
there would be short and mild, and the summer, although
cool, would be very long. But such changes would bring
into action a whole series of physical agencies, every one of
which would tend still further to increase the difference
between the climates of the two hemispheres. Owing to the
vast accumulation of snow and ice in the northern hemisphere,
the difference of temperature between equatorial
and temperate and polar regions would be greater in that
hemisphere than in the southern. Hence the winds blowing
from the north would be more powerful than those coming
from the southern and warmer hemisphere, and consequently
the warm water of the tropics would necessarily be
impelled into the southern ocean. This would tend still
further to lower the temperature of our hemisphere, while,
at the same time, it would raise correspondingly the temperature
at our antipodes. The general result would be,
that in our hemisphere ice and snow would cover the
ground down to low temperate latitudes&mdash;the British Islands
being completely smothered under a great sea of confluent
glaciers. In the southern hemisphere, on the contrary, a
kind of perennial summer would reign even up to the pole.
Such conditions would last for some ten or twelve thousand
years, and then, owing to the precession of the equinox,
a complete change would come about&mdash;the ice-cap would
disappear from the north, and be replaced by continuous
summer, while at the same time an excessively severe or
glacial climate would characterise the south; and such
great changes would occur several times during each prolonged
epoch of great eccentricity. This, in few words, is
an outline of Mr Croll's theory. That theory is at present
<i>sub judice</i>, but there can be no doubt that it gives a reasonable
explanation of many geological facts which have
hitherto been inexplicable. Of course, it is not maintained
that all changes of climate are due directly or indirectly to
astronomical causes. Local changes of climate&mdash;changes
affecting limited regions&mdash;may be induced by mutations of
land and sea, resulting in the partial deflection of ocean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
currents, which are the chief secondary means employed
by nature for the distribution of heat over the globe's
surface.</p>

<p>From what has been stated in the foregoing paragraphs,
it is clear that in our endeavours to decipher the geological
history of our planet, palæontological must go hand in hand
with stratigraphical evidence. We may indeed learn much
from the mode of arrangement of the rocks themselves.
But the test of superposition does not always avail us. It
is often hard, and sometimes quite impossible, to tell from
stratigraphical evidence which are the older rocks of a
district. In the absence of fossils we must frequently be in
doubt. But physical evidence alone will often afford us much
and varied information. It will shew us what was land and
what sea at some former period; it will indicate to us
the sites of ancient igneous action; it will tell us of rivers,
and lakes, and seas which have long since passed away.
Nay, in some cases, it will even convince us that certain
great climatic changes have taken place, by pointing out to
us the markings, and débris, and wandered blocks which
are the sure traces of ice action, whether of glaciers or icebergs.
The results obtained by combining physical and
palæontological evidence form what is termed Historical
Geology.</p>

<p>93. The fossiliferous strata, as they are generally termed,
have been chronologically arranged in a series of <i>formations</i>,
each of which is characterised by its own peculiar suites of
fossils. Their relative age has been determined, as we have
indicated above, by their fossils, and also by certain physical
tests, the chief of these being <i>superposition</i>. It holds
invariably true that a formation, A, found resting upon
another series of strata, B, will always occur in precisely the
same position, wherever these two deposits occur together.
If B should appear in some place as resting upon A, we may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
be sure that the beds have been inverted during the contortion
of the strata consequent upon subterranean action (see
<a href="#fig_11">fig. 11</a>, page 34). Again, another useful test of the relative age
of strata lies in the circumstance that one is often made up
or contains fragments of the other. In this case, then, it is
quite clear which is the more recent accumulation. These
tests have now been applied to the strata in many parts of
the world, and the result is that geologists have been able
to arrive at a chronological arrangement or classification,
and so to construct a table shewing the relative position
which would be occupied by all the different formations, if
these occurred together in one place. In the British Islands
the long series of strata is well developed, but many of the
formations are much more meagrely represented than their
equivalents in other countries. But even when we attempt
to fill up the blanks in our own series by dovetailing with
them the strata of foreign countries, there yet remain numerous
breaks in the succession, pointing to the fact that the
stony record is a very fragmentary one at the best. No
doubt there are many large tracts of the earth's surface
which have not yet been investigated, and when these are
known we may hope to have our knowledge greatly increased.
But no one who reflects upon the mode of origin
of the fossiliferous strata, and the wonderful mutations which
the earth has undergone, can reasonably anticipate that a
perfect and complete record of the geological history of
our planet shall ever be compiled from the broken and
fragmentary testimony of the rocks.</p>

<p>95. The <span class="smcap">Primary</span> formations are so called because they
are the oldest known to us: they are not necessarily the first-formed
aqueous deposits. Dr Hutton said truly: There is
no trace of a beginning, and no signs of an end. In the
<span class="smcap">Primary</span> or <span class="smcap">Palæozoic</span> (ancient-life) formations are found
the earliest traces of life. The forms as a rule depart very
widely from those with which we are acquainted now. The
<i>Laurentian</i> rocks have yielded only one fossil&mdash;a large
foraminifer named <i>Eozoon Canadense</i>. The <i>Cambrian</i>
formation contains but few fossils&mdash;crustaceans, molluscs,
zoophytes, and worm-tracks. The <i>Silurian</i> strata are often
abundantly fossiliferous. All the great classes of invertebrates
are represented, and fish remains also occur. The
<i>Devonian</i> and <i>Old Red Sandstone</i> are also characterised
by the presence of an abundant fauna. In the Old Red
Sandstone are numerous fish remains; it appears to have
been an estuarine or lacustrine deposit; the Devonian, on
the other hand, was marine, like the Silurian and Cambrian.
The <i>Carboniferous</i> formation is the chief repository of coal
in Britain. It consists of terrestrial, fresh or brackish
water, and marine deposits. The fauna and flora of the
<i>Permian</i>, which is partly a marine and partly a fresh-water
formation, are allied, upon the whole, to those of
the Carboniferous, but offer at the same time many
contrasts.</p>

<p>96. The <span class="smcap">Secondary</span> or <span class="smcap">Mesozoic</span> (middle-life) formations
contain assemblages of fossils which do not depart so widely
from analogous living forms as those belonging to Palæozoic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
times. The <i>Triassic</i> strata yield abundance of rock-salt.
In Britain they contain very few fossils, but these are more
abundant in the Triassic deposits of foreign countries.
The oldest known mammals first appear in this formation.
The <i>Jurassic</i> formation is very highly fossiliferous. It is
distinguished by the occurrence of numerous reptilian
remains. Nearly all the beds of this formation are marine,
but there are associated with these the remains of a forest
or old land surface, and a considerable accumulation of
estuarine or fresh-water deposits; impure coals also occur
in this formation. The <i>Cretaceous</i> strata are almost
wholly marine, and chiefly of deep-water origin. But
some land-plants are found, chiefly ferns, conifers, and
cycads. Near the base of the formation occurs a great
river deposit (Weald clay) with numerous remains of
reptiles.</p>

<p>97. Among the oldest strata of the <span class="smcap">Tertiary</span> or <span class="smcap">Cainozoic</span>
(recent-life) division we meet with the <i>dawn</i> of the
existing state of the testaceous fauna&mdash;the <i>Eocene</i> (<i>&#275;os</i>,
dawn, and <i>kainos</i>, recent) containing three and a half per
cent. of recent species among its shells. The proportion
of recent species increases in the <i>Miocene</i> (<i>meion</i>, less, and
<i>kainos</i>, recent), although the majority of the molluscs
entombed in that formation belong to extinct species. In
the <i>Pliocene</i> (<i>pleion</i>, more, and <i>kainos</i>, recent), however, the
extinct species are in a minority.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Post-tertiary</span> or <span class="smcap">Quaternary</span> division comprises
the concluding chapters of geological history. The <i>Pleistocene</i>
(<i>pleistos</i>, most, and <i>kainos</i>, recent) contains no extinct
species of shells, but a number of extinct mammalia. In
the <i>Recent</i> deposits all the species of animals and plants
are living. The Tertiary and Quaternary formations are
partly of marine and partly of terrestrial and fresh-water
origin. At the close of the Tertiary period the 'glacial
epoch' of Pleistocene times began, and the British Islands
and a large part of northern Europe and North America
were then cased in snow and ice. Traces of glacial
conditions have also been met with in the Eocene and
Miocene. The evidence furnished by Palæozoic and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Mesozoic formations points chiefly to mild, genial, and
sometimes tropical conditions. But traces of ice action are
occasionally noted (namely, in the Silurian, Old Red Sandstone,
Carboniferous, Permian, and Cretaceous formations),
pointing, perhaps, in some of the cases, to former alternations
of cold and warm periods. Indeed, the belief is now
gaining ground, that the so-called glacial epoch of Pleistocene
times was not one long continuous age of ice, but
rather consisted of an alternation of warm and cold periods.
And it is not improbable, but highly likely, that similar
alternations of climate have happened during every period
of great eccentricity of the earth's orbit.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
